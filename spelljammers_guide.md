# The Spelljammers Guide
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Imagine a universe where square worlds spin around</span> gemstone suns. Where planets lie cradled in the roots of an oak tree so vast its leaves twirl around brightly burning suns. Where ships of wood, stone, and glass sail the void between worlds and do battle with catapult and ballista, spell and sword, where an asteroid may be a safe harbor, a slaver's den, or a hungry creature eager to devour any that pass by. Where daring swashbucklers and scoundrels race for fantastic treasures and literally touch the stars. Where terrifying beasts with the power to destroy whole planets roam. Welcome . . . to Spelljammer!

In the Spelljammer universe, the fantastic is possible and one is limited only by the depths of their imagination. Sailing ships, enwrapped in bubbles of air, travel empty Wildspace, moved by the power of their mystic Helms. Gravity is a matter of convenience, where a crew of adventurers can tour the bottom of their ship, or get pulled into a gravity well of a larger ship. Worlds come in all shapes and sizes, some lifeless and barren, others full of civilization. Whole solar systems are surrounded by colossal spheres made of an unbreakable, crystal-like substance to protect them from an ocean of swirling light and color, the flammable Phlogiston, which divides the void between stars.

The cosmology of the Spelljammer universe knits most of the D&D campaign settings together. From the Forgottom Realms in Realmspace and its Sword Coast, to Krynn and the Dragonlance setting on Oerth - Spelljammer is less a setting and more a meta-system to unify campaigns with its own extended lore.

This document is intended to be a single resource for all things Spelljammer in the D&D 5th Edition System.

## Space

Space is vast, hostile, and mostly empty.

### Wildspace
Wildspace is what comes to mind when we talk of "Space." It is the vast emptiness that lies between the planets in any given solar system.

** Crystal Sphere ** All the celestial bodies within a Crystal Sphere float in the airless void called Wildspace. Conventional (meaning "those that take place on the material plane") interplanetary journeys around a solar system take place within Wildspace. The regions of Wildspace are primarily airless vacuums, but the cosmos is large and vast with plenty of exceptions to the rules. Wildspace is not truly a void, although it is often referred to in that way. There is plenty to explore and conquer. Adventure is the only constant.

#### Crystal Spheres
All Wildspace is bounded by a shell of impenetrable crystal, called a Crystal Sphere or Crystal Shell. Inside the crystal sphere is the airless vacuum of Wildspace, a place planets, suns, and asteroid belts, a place for adventure. Outside the crystal sphere is the rainbow river of Phlogiston and more Crystal Spheres. You can generally consider a Sphere to contain one solar system or cluster of planets, but that's a tremendous oversimplification.

The size of a Crystal Sphere is determined by the size of the planetary system inside. Usually a Crystal Sphere has a radius twice as big as the orbital radius of the outermost planetary body in the system (ie. the distance from the shell to the outermost planetary body of the system is the same as the distance from that outermost body to the center point of the system). Due to their great size, the outside of a Crystal Sphere appears perfectly flat when viewed up close. The curvature is so gradual that it is completely undetectable to anyone who is close enough to see the Crystal Sphere through the obscuring Phlogiston. The spheres consist of an unbreakable, murky, ceramic-like material of unknown origin.

Some legends state (and theologians agree) that the smooth-surfaced shells were created and positioned by the gods themselves to protect their worlds from the ravages of the Phlogiston, which is held to be the prime matter of the universe. Less charitable philosophers maintain that such shells were placed by an even higher authority to keep gods and men in and confine their activities. Whatever their origin, the Crystal Shells are uniform. All appear as great, dark, featureless spheres of unidentifiable matter.

The Crystal Spheres are defiantly solid. They have no gravity along either their interior or exterior sides (an exception to the rule that all large objects have gravity). No magic has been found that can damage or alter the surface of a shell, with the exception of those spells which cause portals to open. Even this is believed to be nothing more than an artificial triggering of a natural phenomenon, as naturally occurring portals appear seemingly at random. They are apparently immune to the effects of wishes and even the wills of the outer planar powers.

```
```

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/vSoxIhu.jpg' style='width:100%; mix-blend-mode:darken'/>

### The Phlogiston
Also called The Flow, the Phlogiston is a turbulent, unstable, multicolored, fluorescent gas-like medium which fills the regions between Crystal Spheres. For lack of a better definition, it is a river and on its waves all Crystal Spheres bob, weave, and float. Its currents carry the spheres around a shifting stream, ever moving. Very little is known for certain about the Phlogiston, except for every system known is encased within a Crystal Sphere, and no known planetoids exist floating freely in the Phlogiston. Essentially, the Crystal Sphere keeps the Wildspace in and the Phlogiston out (which is a tremendous simplification, but it is easy to grasp). Phlogiston also cannot exist inside a Shell, and all attempts at doing so causes the somehow-captured Phologiston to have vanished upon inspection, leaving no traces. The rainbow ocean allows Spelljamming ships to attain greater velocities. These speeds have defied measurement since the phlogiston is without permanent landmarks or markers.

In general, it takes from 10-100 days to travel from one Crystal Sphere to another. The sphere reached is random, unless you have either a guide or a device installed in the ship to show you the way. Shortcuts exist through spheres to other spheres. Some spheres drift into and out of proximity with each other, so that just because you reach an area once does not mean that you will find it again.

It is also violently and exponentially flammable. An early researcher (wanting to have a better look at some of the ocean he captured) lit a match with the intent to burn a candle. Upon sparking, an explosion immediately erupted from the match head, taking most of the researchers hand. . . In short, a match acts as a powerful firework, a firework acts as a fireball, and the devastation that a fireball would cause may take even the largest ships (and the caster) with it.

## Gravity
The reason everything drags its own atmosphere around through space is gravity. This is also the reason why people can stand on a space sailing ship without falling off its deck and can stand on a spherical planet without falling off the bottom side. Every body in space has its own gravity. Gravity is an accommodating force in that its direction seems to be "that which is most convenient." In an object the size of a planet, gravity is directed toward a point at the center of the sphere so that people can stand anywhere on the surface, and dropped objects fall perpendicular to the surface. In smaller objects, like spacecraft, gravity is not a central point but rather a plane or line which cuts horizontally through the object to the end of the air envelope. Gravity itself is conveniently an all-or-nothing proposition. Either it is there at full strength or it is not there at all (though there are exceptions to every rule, per DM discretion).

Significantly, this gravity plane is two-directional; it attracts from both top and bottom. A sailor can actually stand on the bottom of the ship's hull and move around as easily as if she was walking on deck. In this case, what was "down" on the deck is actually "up", back toward the plane of gravity that cuts through the ship. One of the stranger side effects of all this is that an object falling off the side of a Spelljammer can oscillate back and forth across the plane of gravity, falling first in one direction until it crosses the plane, then reversing direction and falling back across the plane again, and so on until something causes it to stop. To a person standing on the deck, the object appears to fall down, then up, then down, then up, and so forth.

>This trick is commonly used to amuse passengers new to space travel. More than one groundling has gotten in trouble for standing at the ship's rail and tossing an endless stream of apples overboard just to watch them bob.

Along the plane an object is weightless, but it is slowly pushed out toward the edge of the gravity field. Therefore, a creature that falls overboard that couldn't find a hold or isn't tied down, would eventually come to rest at the ship's plane of gravity, and would then begin drifting away from the ship along that plane toward the edge of the air envelope.

** Drifting Off of The Gravity Plane ** On reaching the end of the gravity plane (at the very edge of the air envelope) she is pushed out and left behind as the ship moves away. This movement takes place at a rate of 5 feet per round. Aside from this slight push, there is no relative motion of a ship within its air envelope, aside from turning. A ships air envelop does not turn with the ship when it turns, but objects in the ships air envelope do not drift toward the rear of the ship simply because the ship is moving forward.

When gravity planes intersect (such as when two ships pass each other, or when a ship passes a planetoid), the gravities of both ships remain in effect, regardless of size, up to the point where they physically intersect. An object is under the influence of whichever gravity plane it is closest to. A character could leap between two passing ships, altering her down direction as she crosses the midpoint between the two.

When two ships come into direct contact, the gravity of the ship with the higher tonnage is dominant and becomes the gravity for both ships. A large mind flayer vessel could ram a smaller ship from directly above and spin the smaller ship's gravity plane by 90 degrees, causing everything on the rammed ship to tumble toward the large ship's plane of gravity, probably with disasterous results.

A weightless character who enters the air envelope of a larger body is immediately affected by the pull of gravity on that body. She effectively falls the distance from where she entered to the surface of the body or to the gravity plane, whichever is closer. Normal falling damage is applied, as well as massive damage rules. When the drop is more than one mile, there is also danger of the subject heating up and igniting from friction with the air. This happens after one mile of uncontorlled descent. The falling object catches fire and takes normal damage from fire as well as falling damage. Any sort of control over speed and descent (flight, levitation, feather fall, etc) negates this effect.

Characters who are weightless can move under familiar laws of physics - For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. A drifting fighter may move by throwing her equpiment in the opposite direction.

** Unassisted Zero-G Combat ** is difficult and foreign to creatures used to fighting in normal environments. Any attack roll or saving throw using STR, DEX, or CON is made at disadvantage, and max movement is half-speed.

** Assisted Zero-G Combat ** Characters can use thrust gear or magical flight to assist them when moving in zero-g. While doing so they can move as the item describes and do not experience the *Unassisted Zero-G Combat* disadvantages.

## Air in Space
All objects drag air with them whenever they leave an air envelope. While important, air is relatively easy to replenish. Entering a larger air envelope like that of a planet or asteroid is one of the most popular and cheapest methods. Green plants will refresh air, and some vessels make great use of these for just this purpose. Many asteroid colonies keep at least half their surface area reserved for plants for this reason.

Air around a ship remains fresh for eight months with 50% of the max crew or less. With 51% - 100% of the max crew, air lasts for four months. 101% - 150% of the max crew, and air lasts for three months. 151% - 200% of the max crew, and air lasts for 2 months. More than double the crew cannot fit on a ship, due to sleeping and space requirements. Air cannot be extended by losing crew members mid-travel, but can be shortened by adding crew members mid-travel.

For example: A 30 ton frigate sets sail with 30 crew aboard (including the party), the maximum crew size for that vessel. It has air sufficient for four months. After a week in space, 16 crew members are lost in a large space battle, making total crew of 14. Even though this represents less than 50% of the max crew, it has no effect on air supply because air supply can’t be extended mid-travel. Two weeks later, if the same 30-ton frigate rescues 34 characters from a drifting hulk of a vessel, bound together and limping along. This raises current crew to 50. This bring the total crew count greater than the max of 30. Air supply is reduced to three months, so the air will gain the fouled condition at the end of three months in space.

Any lone Medium-sized creatures in Wildspace or the Phlogiston drags along with it enough air to last 5 minutes. Large-sized creatures (ogres and giants, for example) drag along enough air to last 10 minutes. If a medium-sized creature is standing on a rock 100 cubic yards in size it may have enough air to survive several months, but food and water is another matter entirely.

```
```
Fresh air is completely breathable. When a body reaches its air limit, the air gains the Fouled condition; it smells bad and is stale and humid. Roll all attacks, checks, and saving throws in a fouled atmosphere at disadvantage. The time for air to with the fouled condition is the same time it stayed fresh, effectively resetting the timer, after which it gains the Deadly condition.

Deadly air is completely depleted. It cannot support life that breathes air. This happens the turn after the fouled air supply timer has run out. A creature can hold it’s breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (min. 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to it’s Constitution modifier (min. 1 round). After this, the creature falls unconscious and is dying.

A creature falling unconscious in this way in the Phlogiston is put into suspended animation until such time as they are found or their body is destroyed, whichever comes first. Their flesh turns gray and stonelike and remains that way until the individual is rescued. Some races do excellent business in robbing and enslaving the unfortunate individuals they find adrift in the depths of Phlogiston.

When two bodies meet in space, their atmosphere is exchanged. The class of air (Fresh or Fouled) in the body that is smaller becomes that of the larger body. If the smaller body is at least 50% of the tonnage of the larger, both get one half as much air as the larger had remaining. If the smaller is less than 50% the size of the larger, both get the largers full supply of air, minus one week. The same rules apply for individual creatures, except on the smaller scale.

Creatures that do not breathe (undead, golems, etc) are unaffected by the status of the air envelopes but still carry the envelops and exchange air. The envelope still depletes as normal.

## Space Travel
Space travel is hard to grasp by most groundlings. They look up at the skies and see a vast emptiness of infinite beauty.

Spelljamming ships can be made of anything: normal, sea-faring galleons; gargantuan, mutated bodies of Beholders; ships grown in a vast forest-turned-dry-dock; bones of long-dead dragons; contraptions made from junkyards and bound together by rubber-bands; the splinters and masts of defeated ships; or even the very mountains themselves. What makes them a Spelljamming ship is the Spelljamming Helm, whether permanently bolted down, or temporarily there.

### Spelljamming Helms
Ships travel through Wildspace by means of the Spelljamming Helm - a magical device which converts mystical energy into motive force; ie. the "push" that moves a Spelljamming ship. This allows rapid movement from planet to planet. Some of the specifics vary from race-to-race, and ship-to-ship; While the helm provides the push forward, the crew provides the maneuvering, stopping, and docking.

### Travel Time

In general, time between two planetary bodies is:

Time for take off +

Time to escape gravity well +

Time to next planet +

Time to escape gravity well +

Time to land

<br>

Travel time between the various planetary bodies is taken into consideration, as there is only so much air that the ship can bring with it. For ease of relaying travel information, planetary motion isn't a major factor determining travel times and positions of each planet. Listed below is an example for average travel time from Earth to the various other planetary bodies in our solar system:

||Mercury|Venus|Mars|Jupiter|Saturn|Uranus|Neptune
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Earth|13h|6h|12h|3.9d|8.0d|16.9d|27.0d|

```
```

### Takeoff & Landing
When taking off from a planetary body, a certain amount of time is required to allow the Helm to overcome the force of normal gravity and fully leave the planets’ gravity well. The amount of time it takes to leave the planets’ Gravity Well are listed below:

|Size|Time|
|:---:|:---:|
|Tiny, Small, Medium|Ten minutes|
|Large, Gargantuan|Twenty minutes|
|Colossal|Thirty Minutes

Once a planets Gravity Well has been left, full movement at Spelljamming speed can begin. Temporary ships (Those that have been cobbled together from broken vessels), cannot make a takeoff or landing safely and will Crash, completely destroying the vessel.

Optionally, you may refer to the weather rules in the Dungeon Masters Guide, pages 109-111 and 117-119.

In None and Light wind conditions, Normal takeoff and Land times occur.
In Strong Wind, Light Rain, or Light Snow, takeoff and land times are 2x normal time.
In Heavy Wind, Heavy Rain, or Heavy Snow, takeoff and land times are 4x normal time.
In Hurricane winds, no safe takeoff or landing is possible. If forced, roll 1d10. On a 1 or 2, ship crashes and must be repaired before travel can resume.

## Magic Use in Space

While in the phologiston, spellcasters exist outside the planar weave of crystal spheres. Certain effects are limited or affected in new ways because they rely on extradimensional space. Special spells are also available to those outside planetary systems.

** Clerics in space ** Clerics rely on greater entities that exist only within crystal spheres. They can cast whatever spells they have prepared, but they cannot regain spells above second level while in the phlogiston because the gods hold no sway there. Each shell contains recognized gods that are worshipped by its inhabitants. Clerics may find their gods within these shells and gain spells as normal. They might also find that their gods are not present but similar gods are present. A brief meeting with local clergy is all that is required to learn enough to ask for power. Some spheres may not have similar gods present and clerics may find themselves unable to regain spells within.

** Conjuration magic in space ** Spells that call upon beings from the surrounding area will not function if none of those creatures are located within the spell's range. A call animals spell will not work in wildspace if there are no animals present there.

Conjuration spells will not work in the phlogiston if they summon extradimensional monsters or powers. No power, god, elemental, or other meta-planar creature can be summoned in the phlogiston, and any spell that attempts to do so will fail.

In addition, any spells that place the caster in contact with an extradimensional power fail in the Flow.

** Planar Travel ** Travel between the planes of existence functions normally within the various crystal shells. A character in wildspace may go ethereal, enter the astral plane, or open a gate into one of the outer planes.

** In the phlogiston ** however, the dimensions cannot be accessed. Therefore, devices and spells, including armor of etherealness and portable holes, will not function in the Flow. A device or spell that holds objects in external dimensions will still hold them, but the items cannot be accessed with anything short of a wish spell.

** Fire in space ** In wildspace, there is a vacuum that will not support fire. Magical fire (such as fireballs) will work in the vacuum of space, as it is the sudden creation of fire that requires no air. Magical fire will not cause other objects to burst into flame, however, because there is no air to support a non-magical reaction.

Fire works all too well in the phlogiston. The entire area is permeated with an explosive mix. This makes both magical and non-magical fire extremely dangerous. Magical fire used in the phlogiston will cause an automatic detonation of the spell on the caster.

## The Known Spheres

<br>

### The Radiant Triangle

** The Big Three and Astromundi ** Collectively *Greyspace*, *Krynnspace*, and *Realmspace* are known as the *Radiant Triangle*. Stable Phlogiston currents connect all three, and are the primary spheres of most spelljamming campaigns. The *Astromundi Cluster* also has stable currents that connect to the Big Three, but due to the danger of its inhabitants, it is often referred to as *The Sphere of No Return*.

There are other places and spheres of interest near the Radiant Triangle:

* Darkspace
* Herospace
* Greatspace
* Faeriespace
* Duffspace
* Refuge
* Sea of Shadows



### Greyspace

<img src='https://www.enworld.org/attachments/greyhawk-jpg.108052/' style='mix-blend-mode:multiply;opacity:0.8;width:300px;' />

The crystal sphere of the Greyhawk setting was described in detail in SJR6 Greyspace a 96-page supplement.

** Oerth ** Terrestrial planet and home to the *** Greyhawk *** campaign setting. (This planetary system is geocentric, not heliocentric.)

```
```

<br>

** Kule ** Tidally-locked terrestrial body. Covered with the ruins of a humanoid civilization, but lacking any air whatsoever. A magical cataclysm is suspected to have caused the depopulation. Also known as Celene.

** Raenei ** Terrestrial planet, covered with earthlike features, including animals and monsters, but no sentient life. Also known as Luna.

** Liga, the Sun ** Star. Has many small lakes of elemental water to keep it from burning too hot. Larger than Oerth, but orbits it anyway.

** Ginsel ** Crescent-shaped world that resembles an apple with a giant bite taken out of it. Has an atmosphere on the inside of the crescent. Basic civilized fantasy world.
Borka: Spherical asteroid cluster with a common atmosphere. Formerly a planet inhabited by orcs, goblins and other humanoids, it was devastated by the magic of the elves.

** Greela ** Another spherical asteroid cluster with a common atmosphere, although many of the asteroids bear huge forests. Home to the elves.
The Spectre: A flat, circular disc of rock that appears to vanish and re-appear as it is seen edgewise, then rotates to show its full face. Also called The Wink. Has an atmosphere and water, but no life.

H'Catha: Flat, circular disk of water. Populated by beholders.

** Rock of Bral ** (optionally) in The Tears of Selûne or in the rings of Glyth.

##### Tears of Selûne

The Tears of Selûne is an asteroid cluster, visible from the surface of Abeir-Toril that follows the moon Selûne in its orbit around the planet. Each "tear" is less than 10 miles across.

Spacefarers tend to believe that they were created by a deity new to the sphere to hide the castle in the center of the cluster where it lives. Many have attempted to investigate the castle but none have returned alive.

Most human legends tell of the goddess Selûne who fell in love with a handsome warrior who turned out to be an evil shapechanging monster bent on destruction and conquest. She sealed the warrior and his minions in a gem made of her life essence and wept with the tears coming to rest trailing the satellite of her namesake.

The popular belief amongst those versed in such matters is that they are just a normal asteroid cluster that got caught up in the wake of Selûne. There are hundreds of them, circling each other, though the focal point of their revolution is actually a castle.

The truth however, is that the tears are the result of a magic-fueled weapon created by dragonkind to destroy the King-Killer Star but when they fired it, the weapon missed and hit Selûne instead.

Most of the asteroids are too small to have an atmosphere, several dozen though have air envelopes that can sustain life quite comfortably.

** Dragon Rock ** The most active of all the Tears lies on the edge of their formation. Its ten mile surface is dedicated to trade. A single silver piece allows trade in up to a ton of goods at one of the asteroids hundreds of docks. Should a trader not wish to stick around, the cargo can be left with one of the twelve very trustworthy owners where it will be sold on commission.

** The Cave ** Found near the center of the Tears, an opening in the underside of a small rock covered in blue-green grass-like plants leads to the lair of the infamous Batship as well as the unsold plunder accumulated by its pilot. More often than not, the pilot is aware of the presence of intruders nearby and will try to draw them away from the cave.

** Journey's Legg ** A Neogi stronghold. The nearly eight mile wide rock is well fortified and always further protected by at least 10 varying neogi ships. Nearly all neogi attacks in this section of Realmspace originate from here and all slaves captured by the neogi are sent here before being sold.

** Eye of the Sky **
This is a Beholder base two miles wide and containing hundreds of Beholders in a labyrinth of tunnels and caverns. No one has ever successfully attacked the asteroid.

** The Citadel **
All dwarves leaving Toril's atmosphere for the first time make their first port of call here. No other races are allowed to set foot here unless accompanied by dwarves. This is where new dwarven travelers are informed of the dangers of space travel. All dwarves staying here must pay a fee of three gold pieces.

** The Castle ** This castle doesn't have a name but it is marvelous to look at. It is beautifully constructed with magically lit spires that reach a hundred feet above the ground. The grounds themselves are covered in long green grass and constantly blooming bushes. An overturned magical chalice pours water constantly which flows out of the citadel's doors and eventually out into space. The asteroid is populated by ravens (who are prevented from escaping the air envelope) and brown puddings which prey on the ravens. No sentient being would want to live here once they discover that fact as the puddings are extremely difficult to dislodge when not hungry, making complete eradication of them near-impossible.

### Rock of Bral

The Rock of Bral, more commonly just called “The Rock,” is a merchant city of humans and humanoids situated on an asteroid. The Rock is about 1 mile long, half that in width and depth. The long axis of the rock is a rough oval shape. It is often considered one of the main trading and quest hubs of the Spelljammer Universe, providing many of the necessary marketplaces, watering holes, guild halls, and people of interest to acquire and prepare a number of different quests.

** The City ** The city of Bral is divided into High City and Low City. The High City runs along the trailing half of the asteroid and is dominated by the castle of Prince Andru. A long wall with numerous checkpoints separates High City from Low City.

** Gravity Plane ** The central plane of gravity runs lengthwise through the Rock. The “Upper” half of the Rock is dominated by the City of Bral itself. The “Lower” half is property of the prince, and used as a base for his private fleet.

** Lake Bral ** Bral has a large chasm just forward of Prince Andru’s citadel, filled with water, which provides most of the water needs of the population. The chasm runs below the gravity plane of the asteroid, so that Lake Bral has two surfaces: one on the “top” of the asteroid, the other in a cavern deep within the heart of the Rock. Activate animal cultures and “clean-up crew”-type monsters take care of most of the wastes.

** The Edge ** The Rock slopes away sharply from its top and bottom, forming cliffs which serve as a barrier from one side to the other. Internal passages often make transit easier, but the would-be rock climber runs the risk of falling off the Rock.

```
```

** Underside ** The “lower” half of the Rock is property of the prince and used both as a station for his naval units and as a parkland to provide food and air for the Rock. The bulk of the underside is fields where convicted criminals and “servants of the king” (indentured slaves) do most of the work. Most of the Prince’s naval units are found in an underside hangar. The largest buildings on the underside are the Citadel, a large, powerful fortress used in times of war, and the Vanes. The Vanes are huge sails made of the wing-leather of a radiant dragon. Though they provide no propulsion, the Vanes are deployed to provide some steering controls to the ship in dangerous situations (like passing too close to a planet).

** The Docks ** Most ships approach Bral from the leading edge, where a set of wooden docks extends into wildspace to take in new arrivals (landing a ship in the city without the prince’s permission is a major offense, good for a few months on underside as a field hand). Caverns at the gravity plane extend into the Rock itself, where storage areas have been established with hoists to the warehouses “upside”.

** The Wandering Rock ** The Rock of Bral is not stationary. It can teleport or drift between different spheres at regular or irregular intervals. Some common places the Rock of Bral has been found:

* The Grinder in Greyspace
* The moons of Zivilyn in Krynnspace
* The Tears of Selune in Realmspace
* The rings of Glyth in Realmspace
* Bralspace / Spiralspace

### The Astromundi Cluter
Far off the traveled paths of Wildspace, a lone crystal sphere bobs in the phlogiston, waiting for unwary visitors greedy for adventure. This is the Astromundi Cluster, a setting easy to find ... and nigh-impossible to escape.

Unique among the spheres, Clusterspace holds no planets - only thousands of asteroids that wander in a seemingly endless realm. Here Arcane, neogi, illithids and humans have learned to coexist in a semblance of peace to ensure their survival. But the carefully-wrought balance of power may change at any time, and heroes have to choose their allies and enemies carefully. Within the Cluster, there are no such fine guarantees as honor or trust between friends and foes.

### Darkspace
Darkspace is a bitterly cold sphere. There is no sun and the sphere is dominated by vast numbers of undead. In the far past something horrible happened in this sphere, leaving it cold and mostly lifeless

** Verin **
 Only the third planet, Verin, is capable of
supporting life but like the rets of the sphere it is barren and lifeless now.  The source material on Darkspace contradicts itself. The sphere is described as containing only asteroids, and then a couple paragraphs
later, described as having 9 planets. No explanation for planetary destruction is given, and the rest of the module presumes the third planet, Verin, survives.

** Shadow Space ** There are expanses where the
bleakness of the Shadowfell leaks into wildspace. In
these area light is quenched. Bright light becomes
Dim light, and Dim light becomes total Darkness.
Temperatures also drop to extreme cold (DMG
Chapter 5.). Finally undead gain advantage on saves
in shadow space.

** Blue Oasis ** Not all wildspace lacks atmospheres,
there are entire stretches that have enough air for
millions of planets. These areas normally are blue
like the sky, and have winds, clouds and even rain
and snow.

## Ship Terminology
Terms of endearment.

** Armor Class (AC) ** Difficulty of hitting a ship and dealing damage to the ship when striking it. Armor Class is usually determined by 10 + Maneuverability Class Bonus + Armor Plating Bonus, though there are many ways to alter this number.

** Speed Rating (SR) ** How many hexes the ship can move in a single turn. Speed rating is usually determined by Maneuverability Class Bonus + Helm Power Level - 1/2 Armor Plating Bonus (rounded down). Like Armor Class, maximum Speed Rating values can change often in combat.

** Beam Length ** This is the measurement of the widest part of the ship from port to starboard (left to right). Important when dealing with gravity and the air pocket that surrounds a ship.

** Crew Min/Max ** These two numbers indicate the minimum number of crew required to operate the ship and maximum occupancy of the ship before air reduction becomes an issue.

** Damage Reduction ** TODO

** Helm Type ** This indicates what type of Spelljammer Helm can be used to run the ship. Most ships can be run off either a Major or Minor Helm, but others may require a special type of Helm not listed here.

** Hull Points (HP) ** Hull points for ships are identical to Hit Points for characters and monsters. They measure the amount of damage the ship can sustain before it is destroyed.

** Keel Length ** This is the length of the ship from fore to aft (front to back). Important when dealing with gravity and the air pocket that surrounds a ship.

** Maneuverability Class (MC) ** Your ships ability to turn, accelerate, and maneuver with the ship alone. Takes into account sails, rigging, size, weight, and other aerodynamic capacities.

** Standard Armaments ** This is the amount and type of weaponry that can be installed on a ship. Ship weapons range from medium-size weapons such as Light ballista to Large-size weapons such as a trebuchet.

** Tonnage ** This is a measure of the physical displacement that a spelljamming ship takes up. For each ton, you can consider the ship taking up 300 cubic feet of space. This displacement influences the amount of breathable air surrounding a ship in wildspace, and 300 cubic feet of space allows one medium sized creature to comfortably breathe for four months. Lastly, tonnage is used in determining the dimensions of the ship itself, crew size, and cargo limit. This is not a measure of the ships weight. The actual dimensions of the ship are unimportant.

** Type/Name ** This is the name or type of your Spelljammer ship.

** Size ** Ship size is determined by their tonnage. See the *Ship Sizes* table for details:

```
```

<div class='table'>
### Ship Sizes
| Size | Tonnage |
|:---:|:---:|
| Tiny | <1|
| Small | 1-10|
| Medium| 11-30|
| Large | 31-70|
| Huge | 71-150|
| Gargantuan | 151-299|
| Colossal | 300+ |
</div>

### Typical Ship Immunities
Ships are usually immune to poison and psychic damage. Ones crafted from metal or stone are also typically immune to necrotic damage. They are also usually immune to the following conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, stunned, and unconscious.

## The Spelljamming Helm

A Helm can be made to look like almost anything: A lofty perch made of hard oak, with pillows in the seat and back, and topped with gold filigree; a sleek, futuristic chair made of obsidian and lined with purple silks; a large leaf, elegantly grown into position and automatically shaping to fit it's user; a meditation bench, as simplistic in style as it is in make; or a large uncomfortable iron throne constructed from the swords of a defeated army. How a Helm looks will speak volumes about both its creator, as well as its user. All will function the same and provide the necessary focus point to move about space. Generally, it's installed onto the Bridge of a ship, away from prying eyes and (more importantly) protected from attacks.

Helms are built and enchanted for different purposes, but generally fit certain power ranges. The more powerful the helm, the bigger and faster the ship powered by it can go... and the more resources a Helmsman must use.

All Helms require the user’s Concentration to function, as if the user were concentrating on a spell. Due to the Concentration required, no more than twelve hours can be spent at a time using this device by one caster. Attempts to use the helm longer than 12 hours causes one point of exhaustion per hour.

### Helm Power Levels

<div class='table'>
|Helms|Base SR|Max SR|SJ|Phlo|Tonnage|Min Level
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Lesser|2|4|No|No|0-10|0|
|Minor|3|6|Yes|No|1-70|5|
|Major|4|8|Yes|Yes|11-150|10|
|Greater|5|10|Yes|Yes|31-299|15|
|Supreme|6|12|Yes|Yes|300+|20|
</div>

Any character may use a helm, though only one character may use a single helm at a time. Attunement to the helm requires a short rest to ensure that the adventurer understands how to concentrate properly and convert their innate magical energy into ship movement. It takes one action to activate, and one action to deactivate the Helm. Characters with the Spellcasting, Ki, and Pact Magic class features can use additional abilities of the helm, listed later in this document.

Exhausted characters attempting to use a Helm reduce the total Speed of the ship by the number of exhaustion points they have attained. After 48 continuous hours on the Helm, regardless of the ship's current Speed or the number of exhaustion points gained, the individual using the Helm will pass out and be unable to use the Helm again until they complete a Long Rest.

While using the Helm to power a ship the helmsman is unable to cast a spell that requires concentration, and is considered restrained. The individual seated upon the Helm can talk and act normally, but cannot leave the Helm while the ship is in motion.

While piloting, the Helmsman can observe her surroundings normally, but also gains an awareness of the space around the ship. As an action, you can see from any point in or on the ship until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

### Installing a Helm
The actual cost of a helm tends to be compounded by the cost of arcane rituals and labor required to prepare the vessel to work seamlessly with the helm.

To properly and safely install a helm onto a vessel the skilled labor proficient in the Arcana skill, and proficient with one of the following tools: Carpenter's Tools, Tinker's Tools, or Vehicles, any is required. A skilled arcane artisan can finish an installation in a week of work for approximately 5,000 gp in materials and rituals components.

#### Makeshift installations
It is technically possible to quickly and haphazardly install a helm into place in much less time, and without paying any installation costs. A makeshift installation of this kind can be performed in 10 minutes and by passing an Intelligence (Arcana) check of a DC 15. On a success the helm is precariously installed, on a failed check the helm has not yet been installed yet, and further attempts to quickly install the helm are made at disadvantage.

Until properly installed there is a 50% chance each round that a spell slot used by the helmsman does not take effect immediately, requiring the helmsman to main concentration until the spell takes effect, re-rolling each round, or the spell slot is lost. Additionally, the helmsman has disadvantage on Concentration saves to maintain spells and Constitution saves to avoid Jammer Shocks, described below, while attuned to a helm that has not been properly installed.

> ##### The Arcane
The trade of Spelljamming Helms is highly regulated by a mysterious race of huge lanky blue giants known as The Arcane. The Arcane seem to have some form of omnisentience, and are capable of just knowing where and when the trade of a helm is taking place, many times arriving just in time, or shortly after, to provide "their services" to register any trades, or "assist" with negotiations, or helm installations. Of course all for nothing more than their just share of the profits.
>
>It must be noted that The Arcane are not a belligerent race, preferring to the Planeshift away at the first sign of violence. However precisely because The Arcane greatly dislike violence, they typically have a number of powerful bodyguards at their service that are more than glad to deal with any rowdy customers. Even if an Arcane is forced to temporarily put negotiations on hold, they will never just let a "customer" go. The Arcane maintain enormous networks of connections, keep detailed ledgers, and have a knack to be there are the righttime to close a deal that makes even Devils and Yugoloth jealous.

### Helm Types
Spelljamming Helms all require feul to activate and use. Different types of Helms use different resources, but all require *something*. Soem use arcane energies while others use fire force. Even others consume Magic Items, Artifacts, or Planar Crystals.

** Arcane Helm **

** Lifejammer Helm ** Favored by the Neogi and other evil races of spacefarers, Lifejammer Helms feed off of the life energies of an individual within (who is, more often than not, there against their will). These helms suck the very life from the user to power a vessel and perform special maneuvers.

Lifejammers use Hit Points for fuel. When interacting with the Helm, the Helmsman takes 1d8 Hit Points of damage for each unit of fuel spent.

** Deathjammer Helm **

** Furnace Helm ** These early forms of helm developed by the Arcane are powered by magic items. They can only be used within a Crystal Sphere. If used in the Flow, they will explode. The spell slot equivalent of items fed into the furnace depends on their rarity . A furnace helm functions as a major helm. The propulsion provided lasts for 1 week:

** Artifurnace Helm ** An artifurnace is the ultimate furnace. It is tailored to siphon energy from a specific artifact. The Antifurnace provides a perpetual Ship Rating (SR) of 5 for as long as needed, does not require resource use while attuning, but the Helmsman may still expend additional resources to increase the SR as if the Artifurnace was a Greater Helm.

The artifurnace is destroyed if the artifiact is ever removed. Artifurnaces are extremely rare, and when people discover that one is in use it tends to cause massive battle over it. They also have bonus fun of attracting the attention of the powers tied to the Artifact being used. An Artifurnace can power and move any known ship (per DM's discretion).

** Ki Helm **

** Orbus Helm ** Mutated and specially grown Beholder-kin, used by the various Beholder races to provide movement to their otherworldly vessels.
Artiforge - This device is installed in a ships core and provides the force necessary for movement throughout space without a helmsman. This does require a forgemaster and a portion of the crew forging to ensure proper upkeep and use of the forge itself. As this doubles as a blacksmiths forge for creating weapons and armor, a certain output of those forge-created items is needed in order to keep the fire burning and the ship moving forward.

** Pool Helm **

** Planar Crystal Helm **

** Gnomish Helm ** Rock gnomes, or tinker gnomes, have highly elaborate mechanical helms resembling perpetual motion machines, with cogs, counterweights, bells, whistles and giant hamster wheels. A gnomish helm can function as either a major or minor helm.

A tinker gnome helmsman need not be a spellcaster to operate this kind of helm, but must be able to maintain the flow of energy generated by its gizmos and contraptions. To operate this kind of helm one must have proficiency in both vehicles (Spelljammer) and tinker's tools.

Speed is determined by by the number of complex "gadgets" attached to the helm. More will increase the speed of the vessel at the cost of more frequent breakdowns. Two gadgets are required to produce a speed equivalent to a first level spell slot, with each device added after that increasing the spell slot equivalent by 1. For each gadget added above the first two a cumulative 5% chance of breakdown is added to the base breakdown chance of 20% each day. Bringing the ship back into workable condition requires 7 days of work by a character proficient in tinker's tools. The time needed for repairs may be split between any eligible creatures that work on them.

** Forge Helm ** A forge helm is powered by the creative energy of dwarves. A forge requires 2 or more workshops.

Spellcaster spell slots cannot be expended through a forge helm. Instead, the forge generates a spell slot equivalent as long as a certain number of workshops are fully worked (2 craftspersons per workshop) For travel, workshops must be crewed continuously. It takes 2 fully manned workshops to create 1 spell slot leavel. 2 work shops can move a ship with 300 tons or less. for each additional workshop an additional 450hp can be moved up to 7200hp(a total of 12 workshops) More than 12 workshops will not increase the hp limit but still adds TR.

Forge helms have an advantage in that they can provide constant motive force while craftspeople are working, and useful goods are produced. The disadvantage is that the vessel must devote significant space to workshops (and cargo space for raw materials and goods), and it cannot achieve the maneuverability of a high-level caster at a spelljammer helm.

Generally speaking, one craftsperson uses 2 1/2-gp worth of materials, weighing 25 lbs, to create 5-gp worth of produced goods, per day.

For example, if a ship has 8 workshops being worked (with 16 craftspeople), the helmsman gains 4 TR for use in travel or combat. For one day's travel, this uses up 40 gp of materials (weighing 400 lbs). A four-month journey would require 4,480 gp of materials (44,800 lbs, or about 22 tons).

** Sequence Helms ** This helm type allows for multiple characters to contribute to the overall Speed of a vessel, but halves a single user's contribution to the overall Ship speed. Helm Rating - detailed on the next page - is calculated normally, then halved, rounded down. The number of Sequence helms able to contribute to the ship speed on a single vessel is unlimited.

Rare and otherwise legendary Helms allow full casting while simultaneously piloting the ship, remote control of a ship, full movement about the vessel, and much more!

\page

### Attuning to a Helm
To move a ship with the power of a Spelljamming helm a creature capable of casting spells must attune to the helm.The sensation of being attuned to a typical helm is akin tobeing immersed in warm water. Although some helms are designed to provide other pleasant and unpleasant sensations.

### Non-Traditional Helmsman
The rules for controlling a spelljamming helm assumes a traditional spellcasting character class such as a wizard or cleric, but there are other options for classes, some presented here.

** Barbarians ** They would not seem like a good fit for a helmsman, however they make excellent Life-Jammer helmsmen thanks to their endurance. While raging a barbarian can benefit, and maintain, the benefits of a Life-Jammer reducing any damage in half, and they have advantage on saves against Spelljammer Shock.

** Druids ** They cannot typically cast spells while wild shaping, however they can still power a helm while wild shaped.

** Monks ** They can use ki to power Life-Jammer helms (1 ki point per hit point die), but there are also some helms that have been reconfigured by artificers of cultures such as Wa from Realm Space to be powered directly with ki.

** Paladins, and other innate Healers ** Paladins and some other classes like Celestial warlocks, Divine Soul sorcerers, and Circle of Dreams druids have access to magical healing powers, that exist independent of spell slots. These magical energies are very specifically attuned to life giving energies, and cannot be converted directly into the raw magical energies required to power a regular Spelljamming helms. These energies can be used to feed a Life-Jammer Helm, 5 lay on hand hit points, or one healing die, can be used to ignore ond d10 worth of damage when powering a Life-Jammer.

** Rogues ** Arcane tricksters are an obvious choice for a rogue helmsman, however the Thief rogue deserves special mention, because at 13th level they gain the Use Magic Device feature, which can be used to basically power a helm without any inherent spell casting abilities. The cannot spend resources to perform Maneuvers or increase SR.

** Sorcerers ** They have sorcery points which can be converted into spell slots to power a helm, but they can also be used directly to power a helm at the conversion rate shown in the Players Handbook without requiring an additional bonus action.

** Warlocks ** They have limited spell slots and regain slots on short rests.

## Ship Movement

*“Space,” it says, “is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.”* - Bard Adams

Every ship in motion has a Speed, which is the distance that the ship can move in a given period of time. On a hex space (hexagonal spaced) grid, each ship takes up one hex space, which refers not to the size of the ship itself, but the size of the sky it controls. Hex spaces on navigational maps do not take up a specific distance, but are rather more about the story being told in the theatre of the mind.

### Movement in Space

Out of Combat and other tactical scenarios, A Spelljamming ship is outstandingly fast; even a mountain transplanted from a celestial body (with a Spelljamming Helm installed) will travel 100,000,000 miles per day (about 4 million miles per hour) in Wildspace regardless of ship Speed. 100 million miles per 24 hour day sounds like a lot (it’s approx. the distance from the Earth to the Sun) but Wildspace is unbelievably large and that same ship would take 36 days to reach Pluto from the Earth. A Crystal Shell is as far from the orbit of the furthest planetary body as it is to the primary star. The Crystal Shell housing Earth’s planetary system would take 72 days to reach from the center, and vice versa.

What slows movement among more crowded inner planets is the presence of multiple, occasionally overlapping, Gravity Wells. When a ship moves to the Gravity Well of a large body (10 tons or greater), or when Tactical Combat is detected automatically by the Helm, it immediately drops to tactical speed of one hex per Speed per round until it has left the planets Gravity Well, or combat is concluded. A ship caught this way can descend to the surface, move around in the atmosphere, leave the area, or proceed with combat. Aside from the most basic awareness change, the “sudden stop” does not affect anyone on the ship, and the safety appears to be built in to the magic of the Helm itself.

On average in the gravity well of a planetoid, this translates into about 10 miles per hour or about 240 miles per day.

Tactical scenarios near a large body move this way due to the close interaction with a planetoids atmosphere, gravity well, and weather conditions.

### Movement in Combat
In Combat and other tactical scenarios, the speed of the ship (SR) is the number of hex spaces it can move and/or turn per round. The number of hex facings the ship can change is limited by its Maneuverability Class (MC), a ship can only change hex facings equal to or less than its MC, and each hex facing change consumes an SR of ship movement for the turn.

Your ship Speed is determined by the MC of the ship itself and your Helm Rating, using the formula below:

<br>
** Ship Speed = Helm Rating + MC of Ship **

** Max Hex Changes = MC of Ship **

Ships move on a hex grid, and movement is determined by Speed. Optionally, you may have ships move on a square grid (with 8 facings (ie. the corners and sides of a square), but these rules are designed for hex-based combat. If using a square grid, you may add 1 to the overall Speed of all ships to account for the extra facings that need to be made.

The Speed of your ship is the number of facings that the ship can change and/or hex spaces it is able to move per round of combat. Facing a different direction in the hex space you're in, or moving one hex space forward uses one Speed. You deduct one Speed to turn the ship towards a different hex side adjacent to the port or starboard (left or right) of the current bow (front) position of the ship. You may also spend one Speed to move forward into the hex space adjacent to the current hex space where your ship resides and faces.

Any ship without a Helmsman, a broken vessel, or any errant detritus floating about in the area moves at a constant speed in one direction across the battlefield using it's last known speed. Be wary, as brigands and other ne'er-do-wells may be hiding just beyond a floating rock, lying in wait to attack. . .

### Movement in Atmosphere

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

## Hull and Rigging

### Hull Integrity
If a ship's hull points are reduced to 0, its maneuverability class and Ship/Speed Rating drops to 0 and the vessel is adrift. On each subsequent ship turn, it rolls a *hull integrity* save, DC 10. On the third failed save, the ship breaks up into debris. On the third successful save, the hull integrity is stabilized. Each attack that hits and causes damage to a ship with 0 hull points count as a failed save (and an additional failed save in the event of a critical).

### Surviving A Ship Break-Up

In the event of a ship breaking apart, the atmospheric shell is lost and all decks are exposed to space. A fast acting crew can seal off bulkheads to protect portions of the ship debris from total loss of atmosphere. These sealed off portions can be used as lifecraft, though the supply of air will be limited. If the helm is recoved and a suitable energy source is available, the make-shift lifecraft has the potential for minimal locomotion. The specifics of these actions and checks are left to the DM's discretion at the time of break-up of the size of the ship, nature of the break-up, location of the bulkheads, among others.

### Repairing The Hull
Ship hull repairs can be made by the crew in wildspace, while landed, or by seasoned artisans at a dry dock or shipyard. The maximum percentage of repairable hull points may be modified with certain Officer abilities or other specific cercumstances. Ship hulls cannot be fully repaired without a visit to a dry dock or shipyard.

#### Emergency Crew Repairs In Wildspace
Ship hulls can be repaired by the crew in wildspace at the rate of 1 hull point per 5 crew members per day. The cost is 100gp of materials per hull point repaired. The ship can only be repaired up to 50% of its maximum hull points.

#### Crew Repairs While Landed
While landed, it is much faster and cheaper in supplies to make repairs to the hull and can be repaired at the rate of 5 hull points per 5 crew members per day. The cost is 50gp of materials per hull point repaired. The ship can only be repaired up to 75% of its maximum hull points.

#### Crew Repairs at a Dry Dock
Dry docks on planets and moons can be rented for the average cost of 10gp per ship tonnage per day. This is most efficient method for a ships crew to repair the hull themselves and can repair the hull at the rate of 10 hull points per 5 crew members per day. The cost is 25gp of materials per hull point repaired. Dry docks provide all the necessary tools too fully repair a hull to 100% of its maximum hull points.

```
```

#### Shipyard Repairs
A ship's crew can commission hull repairs at a full service shipyard. The shipyard engineers repair the hull at the rate of 100 hull points per day for the cost of 50gp per hull point repaired.

### Rigging
Most spelljamming vessels have rigging, though the particular rigging takes many forms such as sails, vanes, wings, and ligaments (among others). No matter the form, they are all responsible for a ships maneuverability. If the rigging is damaged, the ship's *Maneuverability Class* suffers. Likewise, rigging can be reinforced or upgraded, granting a bonus to MC.

### Repairing the Rigging
Rigging can be repaired by 5 crew members at the rate 1 Maneuverability Class point per hour. During this time the ship cannot be underway.

## Ship Equiptment and Upgrades

### Upgrades
There are many upgrade optinos for the hull and rigging avilable at some dry docks and most shipyards. Many of the upgrades have trade offs with durability, maneuverability, speed, tonnage, AC, etc.

### Gnomish Devices

The Tinker Gnomes are renown throughout the multiverse for clever migical devices that aid in spelljamming.

## Hazards

### Crashes

A ship that experiences a crashed condition, takes half of its maximum Hull Points in damage, If this reduces the ship below 0 Hull Points, it must make an immediate ship break-up save.

The object or ship taht is crashed into takes Hull Point or Hit Point damage equal the the Hull Points of the crashing ship *before* crash damage was calculated.

Creature on both ships involved in a crash experience the Ship Shaken Hazzard.

Crashes can happen in a number of different circumstances:

* A ship attempts to ram or gets rammed a ship 2 sizes or more larger than itself
* A ship without a ram attempts to ram another ship.
* A ship, in motion, but without a helmsman hits a stationary object or another ship.
* A spacial anomaly pushes a ship into another object or ship.

In the case of a spacial anomaly, a ship in motion without a helmsman, or other similar cases, the ship in motion makes a ramming attack against the other ship or object. If the attack succeeds, the ship crashes.

### Crew Casualty
The ship's deck and hull do not guarenteed protection and invulnerability to the crew. Some attacks, anomalies, and other hazzards can damage or kill individual crew and full teams. If the crew team is damaged includes an officer, the officer will also be damaged.

### Fire
Nothing strikes fear in a crew more than an unchecked fire. It consumes the atmosphere and weakens the structural integrity of the ship. Also, it burns. Fires can be started many ways, from critical hits in combat, explosive/incendiary rounds, alchemist fire weapons, spacial anomalies, failed equiptment, flammable cargo, and of course, sabotage.

Fires aboard the ship, ocne started, grow to the surrounding squares. Every minute that a fire burns, it expands to the surrounding tiles. If the fire reaches the helm, the helm is damaged, requiring a minimum of 1d4 days to repair. Fires reduce the breathable air in the atmospheric shell, the longer it burns, the higher the risk grows for the crews' ability to breath. The DM has discretion when deciding the impacts of any given fire, in context of atmosphere, structural integrity, and ability to ignite other flammage structures or cargo.

At the beginning of a ship's turn, for every tile on fire, the ship takes 1 Hull Point of damage. At the end of the ship's combat turn, each tile on fire spreads to all adjacent tiles.

Each crew team can extinguish 1 tile of fire every 1 minute. Water magic such as *Create or Destroy Water* can expedite this process. The speed at which these spells can extinguish fires can vary depending on the excellerant, size, and intensity of the fire. The DM has discretion when determining the specific rate of extinguishment.

```
```

### Foul Air
Living creatures consume air, and once an air envelop is mostly consumed the air is no longer suitable and creatures in foul air become progressively exhausted until they die. After a day of rest or an hour of physical labor, such as manning a ship, a creature must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC 15 or take a level of exhaustion. While in foul air, creatures cannot recover levels of exhaustion, even with appropriate food and water.

### Hull Holed

Hull breaches put the ship at risk of breaking up. The hull integrity of most ships cannot sustain more than a couple holes at any given time. Peircing Rams and Hull Holed critical hit effects are the most common way for a ship's hull to be breached.

On the third Hull Holed condition for any ship size Medium or smaller, the ship must start making hull integrity saves. For Larger ships, see the chat at the end of this session.

If the ship's helm does not extend an atmospheric shell around the ship, breaches in the hull will cause the loss of atmosphere. It is up to the DM's discretion at what rate the atmosphere loss takes place and its effects on the ship and crew.

Each crew team can patch 1 Hull Holed condition every 1 minute. If the breach is larger than a 1 foot diameter, it takes an additional minute per foot. If a breach is 5 feet or more in diameter, it takes a crew team 1 hour per 5 feet diameter of the breach to repair. If the diameter of the breach exceeds 5 feet per ship size classification, the ship must roll hull integrity saves or it starts to break up.

<div class='table'>
#### Hull Hole Thresholds
|Ship Size|Hole Quantity|Maximum Breach size <br> (in diameter)
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Tiny|3|5ft|
|Small|3|10ft|
|Medium|3|15ft|
|Large|4|20ft|
|Huge|6|25ft|
|Gargantuan|10|DM's discretion|
|Colossal|15+|DM's discretion|

### Jammed Helm
Occasionally in a crash or other accident a helm becomes
jammed, and while attuned to the helm you cannot use resources to interact with the helm. To unjam the helm, you must reattune to it by releasing and then reattuning.

### Ship Shaken
The ship is shaken by such a strong force that all crew not otherwise secured must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. Idle crew and the Helmsman are considered secured. Some effects may increase this DC as noted by the effect.

### Siege Weapon Damaged
Every siege weapon has Hit Points, and can be targetted and damaged like any other creature or object. When a siege weapon's Hit Points are reduced to 0, the weapon becomes inoperable and must be repaired to its maximum Hit Points before it can be fired again.

Some effects, like the *Siege Weapon Damaged* Critical Hit effect, only temporarily disable a Siege Weapon. The siege weapon crew is assumed to use their ship action towards repairing the siege weapon. Other crew teams can help rush the repairing process.

Rams cannot be damaged as they are extensions of the ship's hull.

```
```

### Spatial Anomalies
Wildspace is vast and diverse...and sometimes dangerous. Spacefarers whom travel often will inevitably encounter near unexplainable anomalies in deep space or in the Phlogiston. These anomalies can take many forms, from clouds of wild magic and pocket dimensional rifts to temporal loops and powerful conscious energy beings.

Each encounter with a spacial anomaly is bound to be unique and potentially deadly.

### Spelljammer Shock

A creature attuned to a helm can "feel" the ship, including damage and impacts. Certain critical hits and other attacks can disrupt the Helm and shock the Helmsman. In the event of the Spelljammer Shock condition, the Helmsman must make a Concentration Check (DC 13). On a failed check the Helmsman is shocked for 1d4 minutes. While shocked, they are unable to control the helm, after which they are free to begin piloting again. On a successful check they continue concentrating and retain control of the helm.

In the case of multiple Helmsman, they all must make the save. In the case of Foundries, Artifurnaces, or other helms not using a Helmsman for power, the Helm itself is rendered nonfunctional for 1d4 days while being repaired.

Some effects may even damage the Halmsman and will note the specifics of the damage.

# Ship Combat
<br>
*"All civilizations become either spacefaring or extinct."*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Sagan the Great
## Ship Combat Round

### Initiative
At the start of combat, each ship rolls initiative adding its *Maneuverability Class (MC)* to the roll. Each ship takes its turn in order of initiative from highest to lowest. On a tie, the ship with a higher MC will take precedence. On a further tie, initiative will be decided by consecutive contested initiative rolls between those ships that tied initiative.

Each round of ship combat takes 1 minute (10 tactical turns). After each ship combat round, up to 10 rounds of tactical combat can take place before the next ship combat round. At the start of the first round of tactical combat, each crew member engaged in combat rolls initiative. Any crew member that engages in hand to hand combat for too long cannot assist the ship with any ship combat actions on the next ship combat turn. If a crew member mans their station for half or more of the hand to hand combat rounds between ship combat rounds, they will be able to take a crew action on the next ship combat round.

If hand to hand combat ceases midway between two ship combat rounds, each player can decide how to use the remaining time (including returning to their station) before starting the next ship combat round.

> ##### Variant: custom round ratio
> The ratio of ship combat vs. hand to hand combat Can be altered by the DM to suit the party and play style. Less hand to hand combat rounds between ship combat rounds will intensify the sense of urgency but add complexity to the tactical situation. Too few rounds and boarding actions become rushed and are outpaced by ship combat.
>
> The longer raw ratio (10/1) is intended to seperate ship tactical considerations from the immediacy of hand to hand combat while simulating the slow and deliberate nature of naval engagements.

<br>

### Ship Actions
On each ship's turn, the ship and crew may take the following collective actions:

** Move/Turn ** The ship's helmsman moves and/or turns hex facings up to a maximum of its *Ship Speed*. The Helmsman can ram other ships or shear rigging as part of the move action.

** Turn ** The ship's helmsman turns the number of hexes equal to its *Maneuverability Class (MC)*

** Attack ** The ship's weapon crews make attacks with the ship's seige weapons. Crew members can also forgo attacks to attempt to grapple another ship.

** Officer Actions ** Each officer and/or player character can take an action to assist the ship in ship combat, choosing from the list of possible ship combat actions for their title/rank. This includes tactial commands, maneuvers, among many others. See the section on *Officer Actions*.

** Crew Actions ** While most crew will be busy operating siege weapons or working on tasks with specific officers, those that do not have any tasks can be given a handful of less spcialized duties to perform.

### Attacks of Opportunity
Ships do not have attacks of Opportunity.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
\page

### Officer Actions

During your ships turn, each character may perform one Officer Action pertaining to their ship role. If a character is not assigned a ship role or if they choose to forgo a crew action, they may take one normal round of combat actions. You may use your Officer Action and/or normal round of combat actions to cast spells, perform attacks, dance, talk, or any number of other actions that could normally take place in combat. All actions are presumed to take the duration of the ship combat round.

Officer Actions are usually declared at the beginning of the ship combat round and take place simultaneously once the ship's turn proceeds. If a ship doesn't have enough members to crew the siege weapons and repair damage while also repelling invaders, then priorities will have to be decided. Many Officer Actions are listed below for each role on a ship, but this is not an exhaustive list.

The rule is that if a player can perform the action and explain how their described Officer Action would help the ship, crew, or situation in any way and would reasonably take under the duration between ship rounds (1 minute raw), it can be considered their Officer Action for the turn. Players are encouraged to come up with new and unique solutions. DM's are encouraged to say "yes", "no", and "yes and no". (player beware of the clever DM)

A ship combat round, with each character performing an Officer Action (or one normal round of hand to hand combat actions), lasts for one minute raw. If a player wishes to cast a spell with a one minute casting time, then no Officer Action can be used that round for that character, as they are busy casting a spell.

If an officer mans their station for half or more of the hand to hand combat rounds between ship combat rounds, they will be able to take an Officer Action on the next ship combat round. Otherwise they will be limited to a single round of hand to hand combat actions.

Several Officer Actions reference and target a group of crew members. This group includes a number of crew members and the ship role overseeing that group. For example, if three crew members are needed to operate a siege weapon, and an incoming attack scores a Deck Crew Casualty critical hit, then the group targeted in this way would be those three crew members at that siege weapon and the party member assigned to the Master Gunner ship role, or any other officer near the targeted group.

```
```

### Player/NPC Crew Actions
If a player character or npc does not have an Officer Role, they can still support the ship in a number of ways by taking a Player Crew Action. An officer may also forgo their Officer Action to take a Player Crew Action:

** 1 Hand-to-Hand Action ** A single full action with movement. This action is most often taken to provide assistance with the "Help" action, to heal a crew member, or to attack another ship that is in the same hex. This action can be taken at any time throughout the ship's turn.

** Throw Grapple ** The character or NPC makes a thrown attack against the AC of another ship sharing the same hex as the character's ship. On hit, the target does not take any damage but is effected by the grapple. If enough grapples hit, the target gains the Grappled condition.

** Use Long Range Spell Focus ** The character can use the long range range spell focus to cast a spell with much greater range. The spell must be a ranged attack or aoe spell. It cannot have range of self or touch. Please see the details for the long range spell focus in the Siege Weapons section.

** Aim Siege Weapon ** A character can assist a siege weapon team in aiming. If the character is proficient in siege weapons, then they can add their proficiency to the attack roll.

** Assist Officer ** Assist any one Officer with their Crew Action. This may take the form of a *Help* action with an officer's roll, assist healing, etc. This is up to the DM's discretion.

### Crew Team Actions
A crew team can do the following:

** 1 Hand-to-Hand Action ** A single full action with movement. Each member of the crew team takes the same/similar aaction. They can take their actions at any time throughout the ship's turn.

** Throw Grapple ** Each member of the crew team makes a thrown attack against the AC of another ship sharing the same hex as the crew's ship. On hit, the target does not take any damage but is effected by the grapple. If enough grapples hit, the target gains the Grappled condition.

** Repair Hull Holes **

** Repair Siege Weapon **

** Repair Rigging **

### Critical Hits
Crewed siege weapons often have a chance of inflicting a Critical Hit to enemy vessels on a roll of 20. Other events (Ramming, Spells, Crashing, turbulence from terrestrial or solar winds, etc) may also cause a Critical Hit. When a vessel is reduced to 50% of its Hull Points, it suffers a Critical Hit. When you score a critical hit, instead of doubling the damage dice, you will roll on the following table:

<div class='table'>
##### Critical Hit Table
| d10 Roll | Effect
|:--:|:--:
|1 | Fire!
|2 | Ship Shaken
|3 | Hull Holed
|4 | Speed Loss
|5 | Random Ship Weapon Damaged
|6 | Deck Crew Casualty
|7 | Interior Crew Casualty
|8 | Rigging Sheared
|9 | Fire!
|10 | Spelljammer Shock
</div>

TODO: Additional Table rows?
1. Jammed Helm
2. Atmoosphere Decompression
3. Spelljammer Drive Overload
4.
<br>

** Fire! ** A fire starts somewhere in or on the ship, the location and number of tiles to be determined by the DM.

** Hull Holed ** The attack punches a sizable hole in the ship. DM decides location and size.

** Ship Shaken ** All PC’s not otherwise secured (Helmsman is considered secured) must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

** Deck Crew Casualty ** Choose one creatures at random from all the creatures above deck, on the hull, climbing rigging, in a crows nest, or otherwise on the ship but outside it. This includes officers, crew, passengers, stowaways, boarders, and prisoners. The creature is struck and suffers the same damage as the ship or 2d10, whichever is lower. All creatures within 5ft of the target roll a Dexterity save (DC 12), suffering full damage on a failed save, half on a success.

** Below Deck Crew Casualty ** Choose one creatures at random from all the creatures below deck, in a deckhouse, or otherwise inside the ship. This includes officers, crew, passengers, stowaways, boarders, and prisoners. The creature is struck and suffers the same damage as the ship or 2d10, whichever is lower. All creatures within 5ft of the target roll a Dexterity save (DC 12), suffering full damage on a failed save, half on a success. in the the cabin, deckhouse target, including officers, crew, passengers, and prisoners. This reflects not so much the attack itself, but shattered parts of the ship and loose cargo flying around below deck during combat.

** Siege Weapon Damaged ** One siege weapon (chosen randomly) is damaged and inoperable until repaired. Duration of repair by the siege weapon crew is 1d4 ship combat rounds/minutes. Any crew on the weapon is unharmed. If no weapons exist on-board the ship, roll again.

** Speed Loss ** Ship Speed is lowered by 1d8 for 1d4 rounds (min 1). If a ship speed is already 1 or 0, then roll again.

** Rigging Damaged ** If the ship's speed is 1 or 0, roll again, otherwise the rigging has been damaged. Ship Maneuverability Class is reduced by 1 for 1d4 ship combat rounds/minutes.

** Spelljammer Shock ** The attack has disrupted the Helm. The spelljamming Helmsman must make a Concentration Check (DC 13). On a failed check, they are shocked by the helm for 1d4 minutes/ship combat rounds and take half the damage of the critical hit or 2d10, whichever is less. While shocked, they are unable to control the helm, after which they are free to begin piloting again. On a successful Check, the Helmsman ratins control of the ship and takes half of the damage.

In the case of multiple Helmsman, they all must make the save.

In the case of Foundries, Artifurnaces, or other helms not using a Helmsman for power, the drive itself is rendered nonfunctional for 1d4 days while being repaired. If no replacement or secondary helm is available, the ship is immediately adrift.

> ##### Variant: critical hull damage
> When a ship’s hull damage exceeds half of its hull points, the ship suffers a critical hit and must immediately roll on the *Critical hit table* and the effect is immediately applied. This can only happen once per ship per combat encounter.

## Siege Weapons

A siege weapon is a device that is designed to break or circumvent city or castle walls and other fortifications. Most groundling-based siege weapons are immobile, constructed in place to attack enemy fortifications from a distance, while others are wheeled to enable advancing up to the enemy fortification. That being said, siege weaponry have been adopted to Space Warfare with fervor. All Siege weapons mounted on Spelljamming ships are on 360° rotating turrets, and may fire in any direction regardless of the facing of a ship. Before it can be fired, all siege weapons must be loaded and aimed. A Load, Aim, and Fire action are done using one Ship Action taken by the Gunner.

### Siege Weapon Terminology

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** AC ** The Armor Class for the weapon. Attacks against Siege Weapons can be made as normal, except they cannot be targeted by spells unless the spell has an area of effect or states "target object" in its description.

** Attack Bonus ** The Attack Bonus for a Siege Weapon. Whoever is firing the Heavy Weapon rolls 1d20 and adds the weapons ATK Bonus to hit their target. If a creature has Proficiency with Siege Weapons they may add their Proficiency Bonus but they do not add any other modifiers as they would with a normal personal weapon. Buffs such as Bardic Inspiration or Paladin or Cleric spells can affect this Attack Roll.

** Crew ** The number of crew required to full man the Siege Weapon. When fully supported, the weapon can usually be fired once per ship turn. Each crew memeber performs a necessary crew action to reload and fire the weapon. If the crew team on the weapon is less than the requirement for the weapon, then additional ship combat turns may be needed to perform all the neccessary crew actions to reload and fire.

** Damage ** Lists the average damage, the damage roll, damage type, and any special effects.

** Firing Arc ** Projectile Siege Weapons often have restricted firing arcs due to the ship's construction and the location of the hardpoints. The arc will be described by location and degree of arc. Firing Arcs are described in depth later in Siege Weapons Section.

** Tonnage ** All Siege Weapons, including Rams have a tonnage cost/requirement. This is the ship tonnage used by the weapon when installed on a hardpoint. Ships have a maximum tonnage, so some care should be given about which weapons to mount on a ship.

** Hit Points ** How much damage it can take before it is
inoperable.

** Range ** This is the normal and maximum range of the weapon in hexes (500 ft increments). Just like ranged personal weapons the first range is a normal attack roll, and anything beyond that means the attack roll is made with Disadvantage up to the maximum range. Feats like Sharpshooter do not apply to these ranges or rolls. Some Siege Weapons have a Minimum Range, and will appear in the weapon's notes.

** Size ** Siege weapons are found in various sizes, each fitting a similar sized (within 1 size larger or smaller than the ship size) hardpoint on a spelljamming ship. Typically a ship of a given size is equipted with similar sized weapons. Usually, the larger the weapon, the more damage it does at the expense of a smaller Attack Bonus. There are some exceptions to this general rule.

* Tiny (Swivel Guns)
* Small/Light
* Medium
* Large/Heavy
* Huge/Greater
* Gargantuan

Alchemist Fire Projectors ** These Heavy Weapons have a radius of effect expressed in feet. These weapons are meant to hit and disable enemy crews and have a listed DC for Dexterity Saving Throws against their attacks. Jettisons fire a mass of debris (rocks,scrap metal, broken wood) at exposed enemy crew and always hit their mark. If a creature fails this saving throw they take damage and are knocked prone, if a creature succeeds they only take damage. Within normal range this Dexterity Saving throw is made as a normal roll, within maximum range this save is made with advantage.

Alchemist Fire Projectors lob bottles of Alchemist Fire and if someone fails that saving throw they are on fire and continue to take fire damage at the start of their turn until they put the fire out (1 Action, DC 15 Dex Save to put the fire out). If they succeed they only take damage once from the initial explosion.


\page

### Types of Siege Weapons

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Ballista ** A Ballista is similar to a massive crossbow that fires heavy bolts. It utilizes torsion by twisting a pair of bound sinue or rope bundles. What it lacks in range it makes up for with accuracy. Ballistas do not have a minimum range and typically have a high Attack Bonus.

** Gnomish Sweeper ** A Gnomish Sweeper is a pair of ballistas with a shared, common mount so that they can be fired in the same direction at the same time. The two blunt bolts from these ballistas are linked with a heavy chain (similar in image to nunchaku). The intention of the chain is to be used as an antipersonnel weapon against enemy crews. As the bolts and chain pass over a ship, any creature in its path must make a Dexterity Saving throw or be knocked prone and grappled. Sweeper rounds do not damage the hull, though the Gnomish sweeper can be used to fire 2 bolts in a pinch. Like a normal Ballista, the Gnomish Sweeper does not have a minimum targetting range.

** Mangonel ** The most common of catapults, the Mangonel uses a thick braided torsion system to throw a projectile a great distance. It may not be as accurate as a Ballista, but it has a much greater range and can use a wide array of different payloads. Some of its ammunition types inclue stones, vases of Alchemist Fire, explosive rounds, and poison clouds. The Mangonel has a minimum range, any target closer cannot be accurately targeted.

** Trebuchets ** A Trebuchet is a powerful catapult that uses a massive counterweight to throw a projectile an even greater distance than the Mangonel. A Trebuchet typically hurls a heavy stone. However, like the Mangonel, it can launch other kinds of projectiles, such as flaming barrels of oil or toxic sewage, with different effects. Also similar to the Mangonel, the Trebuchet has a minimum range, though its much further than a catapult.

** Bombards ** The bombard is a large calibur muzzle loaded cannon. They are one of the most feared siege weapons in wildspace due to their accuracy, range, pure damage potential. They are rare, mostly used by the Gith and occasionally Gnomish ships. Bombards do not have a minimum range.

** Alchemist's Fire Projector ** This device shoots a thin stream of flaming, explosive liquid. Though it can be devastating in combat, the Alchemist's Fire Projectors are not popular with ships that cross between the spheres because of the flammability of the Flow. In fact, Alchemist's Fire projectors are recipes for disaster in the Phlogiston. They are popular, however among crews that do not leave their spheres. They have extremely limited range, the ammunition/fuel is expensive, and can be very hazerdous to their ship and crew if damaged in combat. They cannot be fired foward while the ship is in motion as it would ignite their own ship - Alchemist's Fire Projectors are usually mounted Port or Starboard, and rarely Aft on the ship.

** Jettisons ** Jettisons create debris fields in hexes, discouraging ships from moving through those hexes as doing so would potentially damage the ship. When moving through a hex with a debris field, the ship must make a save, rolling a d20 + MC. On a failed save the ship takes the damage of the specific jettison payload. On a successful save, the ship takes no damage but loses 1 speed this round. Helmsman can choose to fail this save. The size and type of the Jettison Ammunition effect the DC and type of damage.

** Long Range Spell Focus ** The long range spell focus enables ranged spells to be channelled through the astral plane in wildspace, enabling spellcaster to cast spells over great distance.

While wielding it as a long range spell focus, a caster can target and cast ranged spells a number of hexes away, the exact range depends on the size of the Long Range Spell Focus, lsited in the table below. The Long range Range Spell Focus can only be used in wildspace, it cannot be used when the ship is flying through atmosphere nor in wildspace. The helm must be powered up and attuned by a helmsman before the spell focus can be used.

<div class='table'>
#### Long Range Spell Focus Range
|Size|Range (in hexes)|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Tiny|3|
|Small/Light|4|
|Medium|5|
|Large|7|
|Huge|9|
|Gargantuan|15|
|Colossal|20|
</div>
### Ship Size and Weapon Effectivnenss

Siege weapons are built to different sizes and styles, each filling a need depending on the target ship's size, range, and speed. Each siege weapon size is designed to be most effective when attacking ships of a similar size classification. A small ballista will be most efficent when attacking small spelljamming ships at short range. Likewise with a large trebechet against large ships at long range.

When the target ship of a siege attack is at least a ship size classification smaller than the attacking seige weapon, the siege attack is made at disadvantage.

If the target ship of a siege attack is a ship size larger than the attacking siege weapon, the target ship has resistence to the damage dealt by the attack.

If the target ship is at least 2 ship sizes larger than the attacking siege weapon, the target ship is immune to the attack's damage.

### Reloading and Ammunition

** Alchemist's Fire ** While some adventuring parties know this substance as a throw-able flask of sticky, adhesive fluid, aboard a Spelljamming ship it is generally stored in stone casks for use in Alchemist's Fire Projectors and as alternate ammunition in catapults. Alchemist's Fire ignites when exposed to air. When a cask is catapulted onto an enemy deck, the stone jug breaks and immediately explodes, dealing 3d10 fire damage in a 15-foot radius sphere. Any creatures in the sphere may make a DC 14 Dex saving throw. On a success, target suffers half damage. On a failure, creatures and any other objects in the sphere are now on fire. Also may ignite other jugs in burst radius.


### On Firing Arcs

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Ramming

Rams are essentially just extensions to the
front of a ship and are used to make ramming attacks. They come many forms to fit different needs in combat. Grapple Rams immobilize a ship to prepare it for boarding actions. Blunt Rams cause tremendous damage, shaking a ship and knocking its crew prone. Piercing Rams cause breaches in the hull threatening the structural integrity of the ship. A ship may only have 1 ram fitted at any given time.

#### Ramming Attack
A ramming attack is calculated as:

** d20 + the Ramming Ship's MC. This attack is made against the rammed ship's AC. **

A ship can only take a ramming action once per turn. It must enter the rammed ships hex.

A ship cannot ram another ship 2 sizes or more larger than itself, or 2 sizes or more smaller than itself. Doing so would force a crash of the smaller ship into the larger ship instead of a ram action. For example, a Medium ship can ram any ship of size Small through size Large. If the medium ship attempted to ram a Huge ship, it would instead crash into the Huge ship, following the Crashing Rules. If the medium ship attempt to ram a Tiny ship, the Tiny ship would wuld crash into the Medium ship, following the Crashing Rules.

## Boarding

There are times when ship combat proceeds to one ship's crew to board another. Often it is motivated by the pursuit of riches, cargo, piracy, and prisoners. Outside of large military naval engagements, it is rare for ships to break-up in combat. It is out of mutual respect between spelljammers to not strand a crew in wildspace, most believe it is common curtosy to take prisoners. Only the most ruthless would leave a full crew to the horrors of an atmospherless debris field.

A ship can only be boarded by another if both occupy the same hex. The ship must be grappled or otherwise immobilized
(Speed 0) for the boarders to leap from one deckwall to the other.

Immobilization can take place a number of ways, some examples:

* By way of grappling hook lines or a grappling ram.
* When the boarded ship has been immobilized by way of its hull points reaching 0.
* The helmsman experiencing spelljammer shock, being knocked unconcious, losing concentration, or is forced away from the helm.

There are many other ways to board ships without depending on immobilization. Players are couraged to be creative. Some examples of alternative methods:

* By way of teleportation or portals
* Through the use of special boarding craft
* Through the breach caused by of a Hollow Boarding Ram

When any of the following above situations take place and boarding has been declared, the boarding party each receive a single move action to board the ship. Then the rest of ship combat round is resolved with all ships taking their ship combat turn. Afterwards, hand to hand combat begins and initiatives are rolled.

Ending a hostile boarding action requires eliminating or neutralizing all threats aboard, and escaping the boarding mechanism by cutting grapple lines, escaping a grappling ram, etc.

### Grappling

Grappling is the most common method of boarding. It also can be used to immobilize a ship of the same size or smaller, or can be used to hitch a ride on a larger ship. Grappling can only take place when the ships share the same hex.

Performing a grapple or escaping from one depends on the method used to grapple. If a ship grapples another ship one or more sizes smaller, the smaller vessel's Ship/Speed Rating and Maneuverability Class are reduced to 0. If the ships are of the same ship size, boths ship's SR and MC are reduced to 0. If the ship grapples a ship of one or more sizes larger, than the grappling ships SR and MC are reduced to 0. In all cases with different sized ships engaged in a grapple, the larger ship maintains SR and MC over the smaller, and can continue to move, turn, and perform maneuvars as usual.

```
```

#### Grappling Lines

Crew members can throw grappling hooks attached to lines at another vessel. They make a thrown attack using all their normal bonuses against the other ship's AC. Three lines are needed to maintain a grapple, though more than the minimum is always suggested. Grappling lines can be cut by crew by way of a melee attack, the table below details the differences in line materials when attempting to cut:

<div class='table'>
| Material | AC | HP | Cost |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Hemp | 5 | 5 | 5gp |
| Spider Silk | 10 | 10 | 25gp |
| Chain | 15 | 15 | 50gp |
| Mithral | 20 | 20 | 250gp |
| Star Metal | 25 | 100 | 1000gp |
</div>

#### Grappling Ballista Bolts

The above grappling lines can be attached to special grappling ballista bolts and fired by the ship's ballistas. Doing so grants advantage on the seige weapon attack, does no damage on hit (but grapples), and can deliver up to 3 lines with a single bolt. Each of these lines must be cut individually. A grappling ballista bolt costs 25gp.

# Officers and Crew

Who does what aboard a sailing vessel, and when? What kind of jobs are available aboard beyond the able-bodied sailor? This chapter will give a brief look into the roles on a Spelljamming vessel. It is advised to establish a Station for everyone aboard the ship to keep the troops in line and the decks swabbed. In case of trouble, everyone knows their job and what to do.

## Overview

### Officers

On a Spelljamming ship, various stations exist that can be filled by a player at your table. The magic of the helm allows all characters to perform arcane wonders. One player character is assigned per officer role. If there aren't enough ship roles, the remaining party members should act as "seconds" to the existing ship roles, Helmsman is the most common role with a secondary. Ship roles cannot be changed during combat and NPC's may not fill officer roles.

** Cook **
The proud cook is a position of distinction aboard all Spelljamming vessels due to the long term benefits that healthy meals provide. They are skilled in dealing and boosting ship morale. Though they do not contribute much in ship to ship combat, they are a force to reckoned with below deck of their own, Boarders beware.

** Master Boatswain **
The Master Baotswain takes care of the repair and fitting out of the vessel, and examines whether it is sufficiently provided with ropes, pulleys, sails, and all the other rigging that is necessary for a voyage. The are skilled in hull and rigging repair, and can efficiently dispatch crew teams with theaid of their trusty pipe whistle, "The Bosun's Call".

** Sailing Master ** Sometimes referred to as the "Master Jammer", the Sailing master handles long range navigation, chart plotting, and maps. They understand the Astral Flow, wildspace, and atmospheric flight. No ship should be without on on long voyages.

** Quartermaster **
The force of personality necessary to hold together an unruly bunch of scallywags, the Quartermaster handles the crew in the best of times and the worst of times. Their duties include overseeing the order and command of the crew, envoys, cargo, and passengers. The Quartermaster often leads boarding actions, directs crew when boarded, and can initiate abandon ship or self destruct commands.

** Master Gunner **
The Gunner is in charge of maintaining and firing the weapons systems aboard a Spelljamming ship. This includes ensuring that all weapons are kept in good repair and that ammunition is well stocked with many options. A knowledgeable Gunner is essential to the crew's effective use of the offensive means of protection aboard a spelljamming vessel. On a ship without projectile siege weapons, a gunner isn't needed.

** Helmsman **
The Helmsman is in charge of navigating the ship through spaces unknown. This station is appointed to, more often than not, the most able-bodied mage aboard a Spelljamming ship. They sit at the helm, which is often below deck or on/in a deckhouse. This role is required to be filled (even if it is just temporary) for the ship to move throughout wildspace and beyond.

** Ship's Surgeon ** The surgeon is skilled with medical equiptment and often trains crew teams to provide medical assistance to injured crew members. They are responsible for keeping the medical supplies well stocked and maintained. The Surgeon can help detect disease and contamination early, quarentining and finally decontaminating when necessary.

** Magic Officer **
The Magic Officer directs the course and looks after the maps and instruments necessary for navigation, and sends messages to other ships and docks. It's not required to know any magic to be a Magic Officer, and this role is often given the person with the best sense of direction and tracking ability.

** Shantyman ** Crew morale and efficient completion of tasks are the Shantyman's objectives. The songs of the Shanyman, sang as call and response, lift the spirits of the crew, even when they find themselves in the most dire of circumstances.

** Swabbie ** The Swabbie is responsible for all the undesirable tasks of cleaning around the ship. Their real sailing skills lie with their intimate knowledge of all the hidden nooks and cubbies of the hold. They are also excellent at making contacts with the less than pious folk that inhabite most ports.

### Ship's Captain
Please have a seat right here for a moment, brave adventurer; We have to talk. You may have noticed that there is no Captain Officer role aboard a Spelljamming vessel.


The idea for Ship Roles are to be the direct opposite of a "Chain-of-Command". This is to provide ease of docking and bureaucracy for the various folk you meet in starfaring kingdoms for RP purposes. This is so that players and NPC's played by the DM have those points to move the story forward at a reasonable pace.


All members of the adventuring party should get an equal vote in matters. The idea here is to keep player agency for The Party's Ship, and not The Captain's Ship.


We are all equal at this round table.


That being said, if you and the members of your group are calm, rational, fun, open, and controlled adults, and understand you're all playing a game, you can elect a Ship's Captain from the Officers. It is customary in these circumstances for the Captain to appoint a First Mate.

Either of these titles have no role nor bonuses. They are merely ceremonial and only have as much power and influeence as a crew will give them. Often Captains and First Mates are the "faces" of the crew, the a Captain often has the role of Quartermaster on small or pirate vessels.

Military vessel have a more rigid rank heirarchy, each individual to their faction, race, and/or ship.

## The NPC Crew

A good crew is the lifesblood of a sailing vessel. A ship cannot sail without a crew, and a crew cannot sail without a ship. They are interlinked, cosmically. The best crews will make voyages pleasent for you and terrible for your enemies. Without a crew, a Spelljamming Ship's Maneuverability Class and Speed Rating is halved. as the needed functions of turning the sails, operating the oars, or maintaining the ship itself will have to be done by the party members. All spelljamming ships have two crew numbers as listed in the chart on Spelljamming Ships and Equipment- The minimum needed to run the ship, and the max that the craft can hold without overloading it’s atmosphere. Crews are divided into three classifications: Green, Trained, and Crack. Standard costs per crew member per month are below:

**Green:** 2gp a month

**Able Bodied:** 10gp a month

**Crack:** 20gp a month

Additionally, crews going into hazardous situations normally demand an extra share of plunder to be divided among the crew.

> ##### Variant: Crew Racial Traits
>
>A DM may add racial traits to a crew member. For example, a halfling crew might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to any NPC doesn’t alter its challenge rating.

> ##### Variant: Crew Equiptment Upgrades
>
>You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s armor and weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage may change an NPC’s challenge rating.

Crew members may be lost through travel in space. As long as at least 51% of the total crew stay alive between recruitment missions, crew status doesn’t change. In the case of a tie, the lower crew status applies. For example: A crew comprised of 50% Green, 40% Trained, and 10% Crack will be a Green crew overall.

Optional loyalty rules can be applied as listed in the Dungeon Masters Guide page 93. Generally, unless the ship they are on is about to be destroyed, no crew member will stray far from the safety of the ship, even when moored at the most hospitable dock.

Some crew members may stick around through thick and thin and develop personalities and traits of their own. Feel free to give backgrounds (as listed in the Player Handbook), voices, and personalities to your crew to liven up your game.

Basic Crew Statistics are listed below. You may find special crew members throughout Wildspace and beyond that may differ from the statistics listed here. There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs:

```
```
>##### Variant: Crew Morale and Loyalty
The DMG has optional rules for Moral (DMG pg273) and Loyalty (DMG pg93). DMs looking to track these values can do so per the rules, though they may not wish to reduce three dimensional NPCs down to a single integer nor deal with the bother of tracking the individual values across the NPC and crew cast.
>
>The ideas though can still be implied. A DM may mention the crew is unhappy with the officers, implying a rising chance of mutiny, or describe a hostile ship's crew as wavering at their stations, implying that the crew may be ready to flee.
>
>This method can provide opportunity for narrative yet retain flexibility in complex social situations.
#### Green Crew
Green sailors can be picked up everywhere. They are warm bodies to fill the ranks, clean the decks, and turn the sails.
Trained sailors are veterans of many voyages, often on a number of ships. They are numerous, but that does not mean they are easy to find. Generally only about 3d10 trained sailors can be found for hire in any given larger city, and 1d10 smaller cities.

Crack sailors are not so much rare as very specialized. They are the best at what they do for a particular First Mate and aboard a particular ship, almost psychically linked to the needs of the situation. Transplanting a Crack crew to a new ship reduces it to Trained status, as well as changing the First Mate to a new party member.
A Green crew attains Trained status after two months of travel (for example, two days of travel, a week hanging around a dock, and two more days of travel only add up to four days), including at least one trip to the Phlogiston.

## Cook

The mess is the true heart of the ship and the the Cook is the lungs. Also called "Master Chief", the Cook breathes life into the ship below deck. Beyond the preparation of food and drink, the Cook oversees crew morale, health, living conditions, and ship culture.

The Cook knows all below deck, it is their domain. Stowaways and boarders beware.

### Features

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Prepare Feast ** Once per week the Cook prepares a feast for the crew. The feast uses twice the necessary food rations than what is necessary for a standard meal. After the meal is completed, all feasters are granted +10 temporary hit points.

** Find Stowaways ** The Cook has advantage on all skill or ability checks to find stowaways, intruders, or any other uninvited guest on the ship. Additionally, they add double their proficiency to their passive perception below decks.

** Preserve Rations ** The Cook is always careful with rations sizes and finding new ways to stretch stores of food. The Cook halves the necessary food requirements for standard meals.

** Close Quarters ** The Cook spends most of their days below deck. They are often in the the galley, mess, cargo bays, pantries, crew quarters, etc and know the intimate details of every passageway and corner. The Cook's movement speed is doubled and they do not suffer difficult terrain movement penalties when below deck, in a deckhouse, or otherwise inside their Ship.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Don't Mess with the Mess ** Never underestimate the Cook, and never interrupt their cooking. The Cook does not suffer interlopers and has a ferocity unmatched below decks. The Cook has advantage on all their attacks made against targets whom are below deck, in a deckhouse, or otherwise inside of the the Cook's ship.

### Officer Actions

None.

### Officer Reactions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Welcome Party ** If a hosile ship successfully performs a boarding action below deck against the Cook's ship during an encounter, the Cook can use their Officer Reaction to move the boarding location and is granted a surprise hand to hand combat round.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

## Helmsman
In Charge of steering the ship.

### Features
** A Natural ** The Helmsman is granted proficiency with spelljamming vehicles. If the  Officer is already proficient, they are granted double their proficiency bonus instead.

### Officer Actions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Maneuver ** The ship's helmsman attempts a ship maneuver from the *Manueverability Class* table below, choosing any one maneuver equal to or less than the ship's current MC. Select ships, player class features, and feats add additional MC actions to the list. A helmsman would be wise to consider their maneuver options before moving or turning a ship as some maneuvers modify certain ship actions for the round.

<div class='table'>
##### Maneuverability Class
| Class (MC) |  2nd ed. | Maneuvers |
|:--|:-|:--|
| 0 | G | None (Adrift)
| 1 | F | None (Turn, Move, Full Stop)
| 2 | E | Half Reverse, Ramming Speed, Grapple Approach
| 3 | D | Speed Boost +1, Evasive Maneuvers +1, Escape Velocity +1
| 4 | C | Shear Approach, Flyby, Come About, Immelmann Turn
| 5 | B | Speed Boost +2, Evasive Maneuvers +2, Escape Velocity +2
| 6 | A | Full Reverse, Barrel Roll, Flank Speed
| 7 | - | The Picard Maneuver, Beating, Evasive Maneuvers +3, Escape Velocity +3, Speed Boost +3, Weather Gauge
</div>

#### Overcharge Helm
When performing a Maneuver, the Helmsman can expend resources into the Helm to temporarily raise the ship's MC. To raise the MC by 1, the Helmsman must expend the new MC in resources, to raise MC by 2, the cost is double the new MC in resources/fuel. MC 7 Maneuvers are only availabe by expending resources into the helm to rasie the MC.

#### Maneuvers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Half Reverse ** The ship can move up to half (round down) of its speed rating. It cannot move forward this turn.

** Full reverse ** The ship can move up to its speed rating. It cannot move forward this turn.

** Ramming Speed ** The ship reaches ramming speed in 1 hex of movement in a straight line (instead of the required 3).

** Grapple Approach ** The Helmsman sacrifices ship speed to assist grappling attempt. The ship can move up to half (round down) of its speed this turn while granting advantage on all attacks made to grapple another ship.

** Speed Boost (+1/2/3 SR) ** The ship is granted a speed rating boost for this ship turn.

** Evasive Maneuvers (+1/2/3 AC) ** The ship is granted an additional AC bonus until the beggining of this ship's next ship combat turn.

** Escape Velocity (+1/2/3 EV) ** The helmsman positions the ship to expedite using the Spelljammer

** Shear Approach ** The Helmsman sacrifices ship speed to increase the chance for a successful attempt to shear another ships rigging. The ship can move up to half (round down) of its speed this turn while granting advantage on all attacks made to shear teh rigging of another ship.

** Flyby ** The Helmsman keeps the ship steady and on course, providing a stable platform for siege weapon attacks while exposing the ship to incoming siege fire. The ship must move at least half (round down) of its speed rating in a straight line, and must not turn. Until the beginning of your ship's next turn, all of the ship's siege weapon attack rolls have advantage, but all incoming siege attack rolls from other ships are also made at advantage.

** Come About ** The Helmsman sacrifices the ship's speed rating for additional turning. For the duration of the ship's turn, the ship's speed rating is reduced by half (round down), while doubling the maximum number of hex face turns it may take.

** Barrel Roll ** Until the beginning of the ship's next ship combat turn, all incoming attacks are made at disadvantage, but all of the Helmsman ship's attacks are also made at disadvantage.

** Flank Speed ** For the duration of the ship's turn its Speed Rating is doubled, but it cannot turn.

** Immelmann Turn ** The ship's Speed Rating is reduced by 2 for this turn but immediately rotates 180 degrees. This rotation does not spend any of the ships turns.

** Beating ** The ship has unlimited turning for the duration of its ship combat turn.

** Weather Gauge ** For the duration of this ship's turn it does not experience any movement (Speed Rating and Turning) penalties while engaging in ship combat while in the Phlogiston. Additionally, this ship's siege weapons have advantage to attacks made against any target downflow (downstream) from this ship's position.

### Officer Reactions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Release Helm ** In the event of the Spelljammer Shock effect, the Helmsman may use their Officer Reaction to release control of the helm instead of experiencing the effects. This is turn will damage the helm per the Critial Hit Table effect for 1d4 days while it is undergoing repairs.

#### Maneuvers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** The Picard Maneuver ** When an attack hits the ship, the Helmsman may use their Officer Reaction to perform *The Picard Maneuver* - momentarily engaging the Spelljammer Drive. The ship disappears from its original location, appearing 2d10 hexes directly forward of its original location. The ship appears to exist in two places for a moment, causing confusion for the siege weapon crews of any other ships in sight. All attack rolls made against the Helmsman's ship have disadvantage until the begginning of the the Helsman's ship's next ship combat turn. This maneuver disables the Spelljammer Drive's long distance travel capability for 1d4 hours.

## Magic Officer
The Magic Officer is the only Role that requires the presence of Gnomish Devices.


### Features

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Master of Magic ** Most spelljamming bridges are filled with magical equiptment. The Magic Officer oversees their acquisition, use, and maintenence. The Magic Officer is granted proficiency in the following gnomish devices:

* Magic Spyglass
* Passageway Devices
* Helm Talisman
* Hailing Stone
* Attennae of Triangulation
* Scrying Device
* Shell Transmutation Orb

They have advantage on all checks made when using (or assisting others in using) the above devices when aboard their own or another friendly ship.

** Miracle Worker ** The Magic Officer, in times of great need, can use a Gnomish Device, reducing the necessary interaction time to a single Officer Action or Reaction.

### Officer Actions

#### Miracle Worker
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Hail! ** The Magic Officer may use the *Hailing Stone* to hail any ship within a 1 mile radius visible on a map echanted by the Attennae of Triangulation. A *Hailing Stone* and an *Attennae of Triangulation* are required for this action.

** Spy Ship ** The Magic Officer uses the *Magic Spyglass* to scan and obtain one piece of information about one other vessel:

* Ship size class and tonnage
* Number of crew
* Stations assigned on-board other vessel
* Flags or markings displayed by the vessel
* Current hull points (described in a general sense)
* Ship weapon(s)
* And any other interesting characteristics per DM discretion.

A character may need to roll an associated ability check to discern meaning out of their observation. A *Magic Spyglass* is required for this action.

** Scry Ship ** The Magic Officer uses the *Scrying Device* to scan the enemy vessel, looking for weak spots to attack the enemy ship or specific stations more effectively. This action may only be performed after the *Scry Ship* action was used on the target ship. Until the beginning of the ships next turn, any attack made by your vessel that hits another ship scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. A *Scrying Device* is required for this action.

** Portal Magics **

** Alter Shell ** The magic officer

### Officer Reactions

#### Miracle Worker
&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Spot Projectile ** The Magic Officer uses the Magic Spyglass to spot an incoming projectile. When a siege weapon attack is made against the Magic Officer's ship, the Magic Officer can use their Officer Reaction to grant disadvantage on the attack.

## Master Boatswain

Also commonly reffered to as a Bosun, the Boatswain cares for the ship, its hull, anchors, cordage, colors, lifeboats and rigging. They are skilled with hull, rudder, and deck repairs.

The Master Boatswain carries a small pipe whistle instrument, a *Bosun's Call*, to send orders to crew teams.

### Features

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Foreman ** When repairing a ship, the Bosun can oversee the process, reducing materials cost and time to completion by 25%.

** Bosun's Call ** The Boatswain, by playing a pipe whistle, calls crew to perform a number of different actions around the ship, usually related to repair and maintainence of the hull, siege weapons, and rigging. Crew are granted bonuses for these different tasks when called by a Boatswain.

### Officer Actions

## Ship's Surgeon

Space is dangerous and over a long enough length of time, every ship with experience casualties. Due to the hazards of ship combat and spacial anomalies, no spelljammig ship is truly prepared without a Ship's Surgeon. Their primaries duties center around the health, vitality, and life of the crew. Ship Surgeon's are in charge of the medical stores, decontamination, quarentine, and triage.

Ship Surgeon's often have medical training or healing magic, but these talents are not prerequisites for the role.

### Features

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Detect Contamination ** The Ship's Surgeon provides expertise in early detection and response to disease or poison. They can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases on the ship. They can also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each case.

```
```

<br>
<div style='margin-top:230px'></div>

** Quarantine ** Once a disease or poison is detected, the Ship's Surgeon can protect the rest of the crew by setting up a quarantine. This quantine prevents the spread of the disease or poison as long as the sick creature is willing to be quarantined or has been restrained.

** Decontamination ** The Ship's Surgeon can make a medicine check (with advantage) to cure a disease or neatralize a poison for a single creature on the ship. This can only be performed once per day.

** Herd Immunity ** When The Ship's Surgeon is on the ship, all crew members (on the ship) have advantage to checks and saves from poison or diesease.

** Will to Live ** While the Ship's Surgeon is aboard the ship and conscious, all crew members aboard gain advantage on deaths saves.

** Binnacle list ** The Surgeon maintains a list of the physical health of all crew members. Each crew member must occasionally visit the Ship's Surgeon for a check-up. The surgeon knows the current state of the injuries, damage taken, and physical ailments of all crew members every morning. The Ship's Surgeon also know of any crew members that missed duty.

### Officer Actions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Crew Team Triage ** The Ship's Surgeon orders a crew team to provide emergency medical triage to any another crew team. Each consious crew team member is healed for 1d4 hit points. If the crew member has zero hit points, they become concious with 1 hit point instead.

### Officer Reactions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Stay the Course ** If a helmsman has been knocked unconsious, looses concentration, or experiences Spelljammer Shock, the Ship's Surgeon can use their Officer Reaction to prevent the effect.

If it is due to a failed contentration check, concentration is immediately restored. This Officer Reaction can only be used once per helmsman per encounter.

## Swabbie

Cleanup, passageway 3. The Swabbie may not be the most glamorous role, but someone has got to do it. It is a role often assigned to a stowaway, as punishment, or to characters who do not "play well with others". From bow to stern, crow's nest to keel, Swabbies find themselves performing an assortment of simple, yet dirty or undesirable tasks all over the ship. Mopping floors, scrubbing the hull, cleaning the head, and painting the deckwalls, are all tasks that may befall a Swabbie.

Due to the ubiquitous and wide-ranging nature of the Swabbie's duties, they hear all sorts of otherwise discreet coversations, rumors, and factoids. They know many secrets about the ship and her crew.

When docked, the Swabbie always manages to find less than savory connections with inhabitants of the port. They are able to make contact with, gain knowledge of, and interact with the many rival gangs, smugglers, gambling houses, fighting rings, and public houses. They can effortlessy massage information from other ship's crew such as their cargo, officers, armaments, passengers, and destination (to name a few).

What a Swabbie lacks in maritime prestige and the typical officer polish,  is compensated for with a clever, albeit soemtimes devious social robustness when docked or otherwise ashore.

### Features

&nbsp;&nbsp; ** The Walls have Ears ** No secret said aloud on the ship, behind closed doors or not, is guarenteed safe. The Swabbie has advantage on all checks to overhear conversations within 25 ft. Additionally, the DM may occasionally pass rumors or information on to the Swabbie in the form of an overheard conversation.

** Swabbie's Niche ** Swabbies know every loose floorboard, wall panel, and bilge access hatch on their ship. At any given time, they can stow away a single package, with a maximum size of 1 cubic foot per ship size (tiny - 1' to gargantuan - 5'). This package cannot be discovered by any means, magical or otherwise short of calling all crew to dismantle the cabin "to the bulkheads" or with the spell *Locate Object*. As long as the helm is operational (thus emminating magic), the Swabbie knows how to hide magical items so they are not detectable by the spell "Detect Magic".

** Smuggler's Sense ** Swabbies have a keen eye for secrets, traps, hatches, and other various "opportunities" oboard ships. All checks made to find (or assist another crew member to find) objects, secrets, doors, and traps hidden on any ship are made with advantage.

** Port Authority ** Every harbor is a small world bustling with all flavors of clandestine activity. After 24 hours in port, a Swabbie knows about some of the rumors, flavors of criminal activity, and the major players at the docks. Additionally, they have advantage on all checks made to gain information about the docks, its inhabitants, places of business, and its criminal underground.

** Bully in the Alley ** Swabbies can always be relied upon to find the best watering holes and cheapest taverns on the docks. They keep tabs on all the patrons and their conversations and have an uncanny sense to locate lost crew members on the docks. If a crew member is lost or missing on the docks, the Swabbie can spend 15 minutes of investigation to locate them to within 50ft of their actual location.

** Crime Pays ** There are always dirty jobs that need to be done. Once docked in port for 24 hours, the Swabbie starts developing criminal contacts on the docks. Once per mooring, the Swabbie can seek out a job with the criminal networks on the docks. This often takes the form of a small job for a henchmen of a larger organization or a unsavory patron of an even more unsavory tavern. The risk and reward of the possible job increases the longer the ship is in port, so patience can pay handsomly. Just don't overstay your welcome!

** Stow Away ** The Swabbie has advantage on all hide and stealth checks related to stoying away aboard any ship.

### Officer Actions
None.


### Officer Reactions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Look out for Number One ** In the event of a ship break-up, the Swabbie can use their Officer Reaction to acquire all their things and seal off enough bulkheads, hatches, and doors to guarrentee a safe enclosed space with at least minimal atmosphere. The Swabbie has the option to invite others to help create and benefit from the safe space.

** Hired Help ** In the event of a boarding action, the Swabbie can use their Officer Reaction to grant them the effects of the *Sanctuary* spell. Its duration is one minute or until the beginning of next ship combat round, whichever is shorter. Otherwise it works the same as the spell.

# Character Options

## Proficiencies

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Spelljammer Vehicles ** You can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to maneuver a spelljamming vessel from the helm under dangerous or strenuous circumstances. You also are proficient with checks related to inspecting and maintaining a spelljammer vessel.

** Gnomish Devices ** You are skilled with the assortment of magical Gnomish Devices used on many well equipted ship bridges. You add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to use or repair a Gnomish Device.

## Backgrounds

### Astronomer

You spent a significant portion of your life studying the stars, planets, and other wonders of the universe. You can use the clues observed in the sky to help you discern realities about the world around you. You are interested in mysteries of the universe and the forces that rule it.

** Skill Proficiencies: ** Perception, and pick either Arcana or History

** Tool Proficiencies: ** Navigator's Tools, Vehicles (spelljammer)

** Equipment: ** A set of either Navigator's Tools. A book written about your discoveries, or 10 sheets of blank parchment and a quill. A set of common clothes. Belt pouch containing 10 gp.

#### Feature: Stellar Knowledge

As long as you have a clear view of the night sky, you can always determine:

* Which way is North while on a planet.
* What time of the day and time of the year it is.
* How long has it been since sunset, and how long until sunrise.
* Your approximate location, to within 50 miles.

In addition to that, you can name constellations and recall lore related to any constellation that you can see.

Your DM determines what the specific requirement for a "clear view of the night sky" is: light cloud cover should not be a problem, but looking through a tiny window of a prison cell might not be good enough.

This ability doesn't work at all on a plane different from the one you did your research on, and even on the same plane in a solar system sufficiently distant that its night sky is dissimilar to your own (DM's discretion).

#### Suggested Characteristics

Astronomers view the world as a part of the bigger picture, they understand their place in the universe. They tend to be humble, and distance themselves from minor local conflicts they view as irrelevant. They adventure to expand their knowledge of nature and the universe as whole.

### Bounty Hunter

However fine and noble the world might have seemed at first glance, once you dug a little deeper beneath the facade, a deeper truth revealed itself to you. Conflict and strife are the only real constants in "civilized" lands, and for you, therein lay the opportunity for profit. As a bounty hunter you had plied your trade well, offering dubious (if effective) services and skills to all manner of client for myriad reasons- superficial or otherwise. Regardless of the cause, the justification, or the moral impunity associated with locating your mark. Every job finished brought the clink of coin between your purse strings at the expense of another poor soul fated to endure consequences dire, and often foul.

Though the time spent in this line of work has left you grim and jilted, your reputation for ruthlessness and cunning precedes you. More often than not, you found yourself sought after and petitioned to ferret a mark, never needing to eke out the work on your own. From the lowly debtor owing the wrong merchant guild, to the misguided runaway offspring of a minor noble, or the thieving murderer eluding the city guard, none could evade your dogged pursuit, and many more dared not try once your involvement was learned.

** Skill Proficiencies: ** Deception, Intimidation

** Tool Proficiencies: ** Thieves' Tools

** Equipment: ** Ink bottle, a set of traveler's clothes, ink pen, 6 pages of parchment, 4 hunting traps, thieves' tools, 5 rare trinkets from previous bounties (roll on table PHB pg. 160-161), and a belt pouch containing 30 gold

#### Feature: Ear to the Ground

You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen mark moves through. These people might be associated with the criminal underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection comes in the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who provides information about the people, places and the political standings of the local area.

```
```
#### Suggested Characteristics

A bounty hunter's sole purpose is to hunt down people with a price on their head, for grievances ranging from the mundane to the terrible. Those who follow this life can be quiet, taciturn individuals as readily as they can be savage brutes living not for the pay, but for the thrill of pursuit. Hunters are therefore often as varied in personality as their marks.

</div>

#### Variant Bounty Hunter: Vigilante

Standing in contrast to the mercenaries who haul in anyone labelled a criminal for coin are those who target thieves, charlatans, and murderers exclusively – and for no material reward. Vigilantes are as often soldiers dumbstruck by newly-found social decay and corruption whence they return home from war, as they are wealthy citizens with a penchant for martial prowess an and axe to grind against their city's seedy underbelly for a past, personal transgression. As a matter of course, a particularly zealous vigilante may come into conflict with a bounty hunter, deeming her as guilty of violating the law as any brigand skulking about an alleyway. If you indeed wish to be a vigilante, select the Crime Doesn't Pay feature outlined below instead of the Names, Faces, & Places feature above. Living a life of vigilantism means that you will always be on the lookout for criminal activity, especially so if you're within the boundaries of a town or other settlement you claim as your home. The promise of payment never sways your decisions in whom you target, and you hold yourself to a higher code than your capricious counterparts – you consider it preferable to turn your marks over to the appropriate authorities instead of harming them.

City guard and militia are likely to turn a blind eye to your unsanctioned activities unless you cross someone in their rank, be they corrupted, prideful, or otherwise. Additionally, as your reputation grows, you will gradually earn the accolades and support of the common people who find their streets safer, and petty thugs less inclined to hold them at knife point over a few coins. At the same time, organizations and individuals accustomed to using their coffers to help guide a settlement's definition of "criminal" (such as a merchant house, corrupt council member, and the like) will gradually grow to resent and perhaps lash out at your burgeoning reputation.

#### Variant Feature: Crime Doesn't Pay

Pulling from your prior experiences as a soldier, mercenary, or even an extensive time living the life of a vigilante, you have the skills needed to wage a kind of psychological battle against the criminal elements of society. When interrogating someone to glean information about the location, motive, or operations of their superiors, they will easily buckle under questioning and often times readily give up sensitive knowledge without the need to press further. Any promises you may make concerning their fate in exchange for information you are not obligated to keep, short of killing them. You can coordinate this information with any authority in a city you're on amiable terms with, be it the guard or militia, your own old military unit, or even a sympathetic temple's leadership, provided that temple maintains soldiers of their own.

### Faction Agent

Untold organizations are active in the various crystal spheres and parts beyond. These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate

anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction's operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don't merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart.

As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction. You might have operated openly orsecretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an adventurer doesn't necessarily require you to relinquish membership in your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction.

** Skill Proficiencies: ** Insight and one Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma s kill of your choice, asappropriate to your faction

** Languages: ** Two of your choice

** Equipment: ** Badge or emblem of your faction, a copy of a seminal faction text (or a code-book for a covert faction), a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp

#### Factions in Spelljammer

** The Imperial Elven Navy ** is elven superiority, looking down on non elves and non starborn elves. They allow such beings into their fleet as mercs or foreign legion style crew but don’t treat them with a lot of respect overall. Any captain/commander/admiral may be less rude about it but the fleet as a whole is arrogant.

** The Green Concern ** is made out of an alliance between orcs and goblinoids out to defend themselves from the genocide of the Elven Fleets (or so they say), but in practice it is a way for them to untie for larger raids on outlying crystal spheres or loose planets/planetoids. Trey allow non orc/goblinoids in as long as they prove strong and willing to obey the orders of their commander no matter how treacherous or violent the order may be.

** The Arcane Consortium ** is a trade alliance between various Arcane (blue giants with an affinity for magic, trade and the construction of spelljammer components) They supply ships and refittings to anyone with the money for it. They are always looking to make a deal or open new trade networks. They defend theirs with as much devotion as they put towards trying to sell whats theirs to you.

** The Fleshdealers ** are a large splinter group of beholder, illithid, and Neogi who, unlike tei brethren would rather buy slaves than take them violently. As such they make a better impression on those they meet, and have actual diplomats and embassies in various territories, as well as markets for goods and services. They prefer to trade in slaves but gold will do where that is illegal.

** The Treasure Fleet ** is a number of Kara-turan and (gaijin) ships and sailors traveling the spheres making trade connections and gathering information to bring back home. The hold no ports outside of realmspace but their influence is felt in many ports despite that, with large Tura-towns springing up with members of the fleet deciding they would like a new port instead of home. To make up for shedding an occasional luster of crew, a non-insignificant portion of their fleet are made up of those hired along the way.

** The Temple of Ptah ** is one of the most forceful proponents of religion in the universe" of course has ties to the Egyptian pantheon and their god dwells in the Ethereal Plane.

** The Celestians ** are worshipers of the god Celestian), "Little in the way of organization," but found throughout the spheres and The Planewalker's Handbook mentions that planewalkers worship him too.

** The Company of the Chalice ** a group of crusading warriors from the world of Gondorin conceivably related to the Order of the Chalice on Oerth.

** The Pragmatic Order of Thought ** a disorganized group devoted to pure freedom. Somewhat similar to the Free League.

** The Tenth Pit ** is a group dedicated to imposing cruel order throughout the spheres. Allied with the Knights of Takhisis, the Zhentarim, and Baator. Would fit well with the Sodkillers (or Mercykillers before they split) and the darker members of the Harmonium.

** The Chainmen ** are Slavers. They work with the Tenth Pit, and I can see them working with the dao.

** The Seekers ** are scholars and information brokers. Similar to the Seekers of the Arcane. I can see them getting along with the Guvners and Sensates.

** The Xenos ** are racists who hate nonhumans.

** The Old Faith ** is a druid hierarchy, but its ascended masters, the Hierophants, have the ability to travel the planes.

** The Masters of Dragons ** (Gaz 3, The Principalities of Glantri). In the land of Glantri, on Mystara, these wizards study dracology, emulating the powers and mastery of dragons. If the High Master of Dragons were to overthrow one of the Dragon Rulers, this group would gain a foothold on the planes with a mighty godlike ruler of dragons as their leader.

** The Masters of the Elements ** are also on Glantri, these are actually four groups of rival elementalist wizards. If one of their High Masters was to successfully overthrow an elemental ruler, this order could actually dominate vast regions of an elemental plane.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
\page

** The Masters of Illusions ** The High Master of this order could build a fortress of shadow on the Demiplane of Nightmares.

** Barimoor ** (Gaz 2, The Emirates of Ylaruam). Over 800 years old, this expatriate Alphatian wizard has otherworldly and elemental minions, over 120 apprentices, and countless agents possessed by daggers infused with the souls of his vanquished enemies in his underground labyrinth. He's not the Harmonium, but if he wanted to he and his followers could make quite a splash on the planes.

** The Ordo Elementarum ** (from The Player's Guide to Blackmoor). Elementalist wizards who spent three objective centuries on the Plane of Time, now determined to destroy all artifacts of clockwork technology.

** The Dreaming Dark ** and ** the Path of Light ** in the Eberron setting, warring faiths that would determine the fate of the Plane of Dreams.

** The Shadovars ** of the Netherese City of Shade in the Forgotten Realms are powerful mages with countless agents and ties to the Plane of Shadow

#### Feature: Safe Haven

As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the Acolyte background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a faction agent. (For instance, consider the words "faith" and "faction" to be interchangeable.) Your bond might be associated with other members of your faction, or a location or an object that is important to your faction. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the tenets and principles of your faction, but might be more personal in nature.

### Scavenger

Battlefields are everywhere, and countless items are left behind. Many people avoid them, for fear of the undead or evil curses, but some very brave, or incredibly foolish, individuals risk everything to gain riches beyond their wildest imaginings by plundering these sites. From grave robbers who dig up the mass burials, weapon burnings, and individual grave sites, to battlefield scroungers who loot the scattered dead, scavengers are some of the least-appreciated professionals in most cultures. Their work is dangerous- they risk accident, disease, and fell magics, and face the threat of being attacked by wild predators, undead, and survivor soldiers. Many gods condemn their actions as a disgrace to the dead.

Why did you engage in this risky line of work? Are you searching for a legendary item? Or are you just seeking to get rich by amassing a mountain of salable clutter? Have you ever had to do something you felt was wrong to get out of danger on the job? How did you get into scavenging in the first place? Did you ever "hit it big", or have you been running a dry streak? What do you think of others in your profession? Do you have any rules about whose body you are willing or unwilling to disturb? Why did you leave a scavenging life to join a group? Are you still scavenging, or did you leave that life behind?

** Skill Proficiencies: ** Perception, Investigation

** Tool Proficiencies: ** Smith's Tools, Vehicles (Land)

Equipment: A trinket scavenged from a battlefield (i.e, a sword hilt, a dented helmet, a scrap of cloth from a banner), a set of common clothes, a warm blanket, a leather sack, and a pouch containing 10 gp.

#### Feature: Keen Eye

Whenever you see something that could be of value, you have a vague estimate of its worth, as well as some interesting information about the item, if there is anything interesting to know. If you fail any checks to identify the value of an item, you learn of someone or someplace where you can have the item's value measured, unless the DM deems the item too rare or obscure.

### Smuggler

You have spent your life hiding in the darkness, making shady deals behind closed doors. What led you to engage in a life of crime? Do you crave the thrill of lawbreaking, or did you enter the profession to pay off a debt, risking your hide on behalf of a less than honorable noble? A smuggler is an individual trained in the art of acquisition, a professional thug who can deliver anything… for a price. Smugglers tend to be more bolder criminals than most, preferring bribery or distraction over subterfuge and stealth.

** Skill Proficiencies: ** Deception, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth (choose 2)

** Tool Proficiencies: ** Forgery kit and Vehicles (spelljammer)

** Equipment: ** One set of common clothes, backpack with hidden compartment, forgery kit, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp

#### Smuggled Item Specialty

A smuggler is no good without illicit goods to transport! Roll on the table below or work with your DM to define another category of controlled substances your character tends to acquire.


<div class='table'>
|** d6 ** | ** Smuggled Items **|
|:---|:---|
|1|Addictive Substances|
|2|Alchemical Ingredients/ Potions|
|3|Exotic Creatures|
|4|Discounted Wares (Tax Dodger)|
|5|Weaponry|
|6|Antiquities|
</div>

#### Feature: Careful Selection

Some close brushes with the law have taught you that not every city guard can be bribed, and some people are simply too keen to miss minute discrepancies. This feature allows you to study a person and gain insight into whether or not they would accept a bribe, or to pick up on whether they are exceptionally more perceptive than you. It does not reveal how expensive a bribe may be for a given situation, however.

#### Alternate Feature: Trained Eye

Extensive practice concealing at items has given you an uncanny ability to tell when someone is hiding something. Whether someone is telling a half-truth or actively hiding a dagger in their belt, you can always tell when there is more to a person than meets the eye.

#### Alternate Feature: Shadow Meld

You have learned how to blend in with shadows, as a result you have advantage on stealth checks in rooms with low to no light.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Smugglers are a highly charismatic and highly diverse bunch. They cover a wide variety of personalities, ranging from the boisterous street hawker with a "special selection" to the burly sailor who brazenly sells his wares after bribing the guards to look away. Your traits should reflect the tactics you see yourself using.

|1|I am extremely sociable, especially over a mug of ale.|
|2|I always keep my wares close to me, you never know who might stumble across them otherwise.|
|3|The only way to hide is in broad daylight. I don't bother with skulking around.|
|4|I'm a terrible gossip.|
|5|Being seen with any unsavory figures is a sure way to undermine my work. I only associate with my business partners behind locked doors.|
|6|Deflecting questions has become second nature to me, so I rarely answer straight.|
|7|I have dozens of identities and live in constant fear of answering to the wrong name.|
|8|I act irrationally confident in the face of danger, nobody suspects anything when you seem like you know what you're doing.|

|4|Someone I cared about discovered my profession and has publicly denounced me, and I am caught between protecting my reputation and restoring our relationship.|

#### Variant Sailor: Spacefarer

You have traveled the space lanes for years and have seen things and been to places that others could only dream of.

** Skill Proficiencies: ** Survival, plus one from among Insight, persuasion, or

** Tool Proficiencies: ** Navigator’s tools, Vehicles (Spelljammer)
Languages: One of your choice

** Equipment: ** A set of traveler’s clothes, a bedroll, a walking stick, a token of your old life at home (roll on the trinkets table), a small knife, and a pouch with 5 gp

#### Feature: Tales to tell

Your travels have given you a wide variety of stories of exotic locations, fantastic sights, and interesting people. Others are always fascinated by these tales and are they are willing to trade a free drink, information, or a place to stay for these tales.

## Feats

### Chief Petty Officer

Can man any ship station during ship combat and has access to perform any of that role's Crew Actions as if they were that role - excluding the Cook. They cannot choose the same Crew Action as any other Officer on any given turn.

### Rocket Rider
Being in space away from your ship allows you to think clearer than your allies, and your ability to maneuver isn't hindered by the pesky lack of gravity.

* Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You roll with advantage on ability checks and saving throws when in zero gravity.
* Your air envelope lasts twice as long in zero gravity. This does not include when on a ship or planet.
* You can go without food and water for twice as long.
* When in an environment of extreme heat or extreme cold, you have advantage on constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion.

### Nomad
You are a traveler, flitting from port to port, world to world, and are an expert at navigating your way throughout Wildspace and the Phlogiston. You've seen things, been there, and it shows:

* You have advantage on Survival checks to navigate and Perception checks that rely on Sight in Wildspace and the Phlogiston.
* The Speed of a ship that crews a character with the Nomad feat is increased by 1.
* You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to avoid gaining the Poisoned, Diseased, Charmed, and Restrained conditions.

### Handyman

In addition, a character proficient with Spelljamming vehicles is knowledgeable about anything a professional sailor would be familiar with, such as information about wildspace, the phlogiston, planets, spheres, tying knots, and assessing safe harbors.
* During each Ship Action combat phase, you can perform two total ship actions from two ship roles rather than one. The same action cannot be performed twice in the same ship combat round. These ship actions may be selected from different Stations.
* You automatically succeed on any Ship Shaken critical hit rolls to avoid being knocked prone.
* You have advantage on all concentration checks against Spelljammer Shock.
* Damage to you from the Deck Crew Damage or Interior Crew Damage critical hits is reduced to 0.

# Character Races


##### The people of Wildspace.

<br>

> ##### Variant: Exotic Races
>
> If you're a player, consult with your DM before creating an exotic race. Many DMs like to consider the implications for their campaign before allowing an exotic race. Your DM may or may not allow an exotic race, and may impose class or other character option restrictions as they seem fit.
>
>If you're the DM, including exotic races in your campaign is a storytelling opportunity, a chance for you to decide the roles that different peoples play in the tales you weave. You might decide that a race here is common in your campaign, or that only a few members, if any, still exist. Whatever you decide, consider how it can enhance the narrative of your games.

## Dohwar
The dohwar are short, pudgy, flightless avians bearing a passing resemblance to penguins. The dohwar has two wings that are useless for flight but have limited prehensile action, allowing it to grasp objects. Though the dohwar speak common and their own tongue, they rely heavily on telepathic powers for communication among themselves. In fact, dohwar have pairings called "mergers", wherein two dohwar stay in mental rapport, even to the point of finishing each other's sentences. This drives other races crazy.

### Society of Traders
Dohwar society is an oligarchy ruled by several trading houses and cartels. They are shameless and sly merchants, always looking for an opportunity to turn a profit. Dohwar pass on fortunes as heritage, but they do not believe, and find ludicrous, any form of castes and birthrights other people believe in. For the dohwar a succesful trader or artisan that can turn a profit can raise ranks in their society, and eventually become managers, perhaps gain a seat as a board member, or start their own cartel and become an executive president.

The dohwar society is peculiarly religious. They worship powers associated with commerce, profits and wealth. However the power's race or alignment is unimportant. Though they love money, the dohwar are especially generous with religious contributions. Seeing such tithes as "investments", with the powers in return for divine advantage in future bargaining sessions.

### Sweet Tooth
Dohwar eat fish, vegetables, and plankton. They are fond of strong drink, and alcohol does not intoxicate them. Sweets, on the other hand, are highly intoxicating; to a dohwar, one apple has the effect of strong beer, and a few tablespoons of honey or maple syrup get it blind drunk.

### Dohwar Names
Dohwar only have given names, but they once they take on merger with a mate, they will use the name of their partner as a pairing of both names. For example a dohwar named Colder in a merger with a dohwar named Artis will introduce itself as I'm Colder from Colder & Artis. A Dohwar that has not yet formed a merger with a mate will use the name of their cartel or trading house instead.

```
```

### Dohwar Traits

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Ability Score Increase ** Your Constitution increases by 1, and Intelligence increases by 2.

** Age ** The Dohwar reach adulthood around the age of 10, and age similar to humans.

** Size ** 3 to 4 feet tall, weigh about 40 to 60 lbs. Your size is
Small.

** Speed ** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. You have a swim speed of 40ft.

** Languages ** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dohwar which is a mix of Aquan and Auran.

** Hold Breath ** You can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.

** Cold Adaptation ** You're naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. You also have resistance to cold damage.

** Merchant's Senses ** Whenever you perform an Intelligence (History) check, or tools check to determine the origin or value of an object, you are considered proficient in the relevant check and can add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. When you reach 3rd level you learn to cast detect magic and identify, but only as a ritual, you do need material components.

** Merger Link ** Over the course of a long rest you can establish a mental connection with one willing creature that has an Intelligence of 6 or higher. While forming the link the target must remain in your presence at all times. You can then communicate telepathically with your linked partner as long as you are on the same plane of existence or until either of you finish your next long rest.

** Mind Reading ** While interacting with a target you can see within 30 feet you can non intrusively read their desires and surface thoughts, providing you with advantage on Insight (Wisdom), Persuasion (Charisma) and Deception (Charisma) checks while performing negotiations with the target. Because you only capture their surface thoughts the target is not aware of you scanning them, however people familiar with Dohwar know they have the ability to read minds. You can maintain this ability for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell). This trait counts as a divination effect. You can't use this again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Dracon

<img src='https://koboldpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Dracotaur-Final-QP-Jaecks-copy-1.jpg' style='mix-blend-mode:multiply;width:280px' />

The dracons are dragon-centaurs that have recently appeared on the fringes of the Known Spheres. They have heavy, gray four-legged bodies with broad, flat, elephantine feet and long tails. Their torsos and arms are human, although their sixfingered hands end in claws. Their heads are reptilian, with the horns and flanges of a dragon.

Dracons are herd creatures, and their lives are comprised of a series of formal rituals designed to allow them to interact with the herd with no dissension. To humans, dracon formality is seen as weak and snobbish; this is superficially supported by the dracon's willingness to flee or discuss a situation rather than fight. More than one human has been surprised, however, at how effective dracons are once the herd has made up its mind.

A lone dracon is a freak. Most dracons cannot survive outside the family unit, and become sick and confused if denied access to the leadership of the eldest of their herd for extended periods of time. A dracon left by itself will try to find another dracon family to adopt it. If this is impossible, it will attempt to form a new herd, even including nondracons in its "family."

Dracons use thin-bladed long swords in war. However, many dracon contests are resolved through a complex form of wrestling that doubles as an effective unarmed fighting form. Since their first contact with humans, the dracons have adopted many human weapons.

Dracons view humans, mind flayers, elves, and dwarves as "the deformed." They are polite and interested in nondracon society but view any creature with fewer than six limbs as disadvantaged. They are not good at distinguishing between the various nondracon races, particularly humans and demihumans, whom the dracons view as one race. Dracons hate the neogi but consider the beholders comical.

Dracon families are huge, and there is good evidence that all dracons are members of one enormous kin-group. Dracons use these kinship structures to figure out which dracon should head any herd, particularly if two herds merge, and leadership is always yielded to the more senior bloodline.

Every herd no matter how small has a shalla (cleric). The shalla is keeper of rituals, healer and advisor to the kaba (leader of a tribe). The dracons have a pantheon of gods. They have gods of war, fertility, storms, and the sea. Dracons believe that like them, their gods travel together in a huge herd, and that the dietic herd is led by the Ub-Kalla, or Full Leader. The Ub-Kalla is a god of leadership and wisdom and knows the correct course in every situation. Most dracon spellcasters are clerics.

The dracon homeworld is dry, with grassy plains, desert, and shallow seas. Seasonal changes keep the herds moving across the landscape, preventing the dracons from establishing any large cities of their own. The exact location of their homeworld is not known to outsiders.


### Dracon Names
A dracon's full name is his geneology, and they take great pride in memorizing this geneology as far back as they can, typically this can go back as far as 15 generations . When relating this it sounds something like "Out of Zirin by Drax ...", where Zirin was the mother, and Drax was the father, and goes on to list not only the dracon's given name but also year born and herd. Fortunately for everybody else, dracons also have a given name and it herd name, which others may address the dracon by.

**Male Names:** Drax, Vorvax, Yrrast'rix, Kh'ziast.

**Female Names:** Zirin, R'ruan, Khaz'zistahn, Eun.

## Giff
Giff. It's easy to spot the giff in a room: a group of 7-foot-tall, hippopotamus-headed humanoids attired in gaudy military uniforms, with gleaming pistols and muskets on display. These spacefaring mercenaries are renowned for their martial training and their love of explosives.

### Military Organization.
Every aspect of giff society is organized along military lines. From birth until death, every giff has a military rank. It must follow orders from those of superior rank, and it can give orders to those of lower rank. Promotions don't depend on age but are granted by a superior as a reward for valor. Giff are devoted to their children, even as most of their education is geared toward fighting and war.

### Mercenaries Extraordinaire.
Giff are in high demand as warriors for hire, but they insist on serving in units composed entirely of giff; a giff hiring itself out individually is unheard of. Giff refuse to fight other giff, and will never agree to a contract unless it stipulates that they can sit out a battle rather than wage war against their kin. A giff prizes the reputation of its unit above its own life. Life is fleeting, but the regiment endures for generations or even centuries.

```
```

### A Whiff of Gunpowder.
Muskets and grenades are the favorite weapons of every giff. The bigger the boom, the brighter the flash, and the thicker the smoke it produces, the more giff love a weapon. Their skill with gunpowder is another reason for their popularity as mercenaries. Giff revel in the challenge of building a bomb big enough to level a fortification. They gladly accept payment in kegs of gunpowder in preference to gold, gems, or other currency.

### Giff Names
A giff has a given name, a family name, and a military rank. Giff society considers knowing your origin of utmost importance, and giff can trace their genealogical origins for many generations, and revere the great heroes and leaders among their ancestors.

Male Names: Horatio, Maxwell, etc...

Female Names: Beatrice, Ophelia, etc...

Family Names: *British surnames here*

## Grommams
Grommams are gorillalike creatures with strong shoulders, long arms (9' span), short legs, and padded grasping feet. Grommams have chocolate brown skin and short, rough, copper-red fur all over their bodies except on their faces, the palms of their hands, and the soles of their feet. Grommams are close-knit, highly religious, and organized; most are lawful good. A grommam family usually consists of one adult man, 1-2 adult women, and several children. One female generally cooks, cleans, and manages the children, while the other directs all household affairs such as finances, purchases, and dealings with other grommam families. They are generally peaceful, with their leadership made up of "director" females led by a demigod. (The grommam demigods openly live among the grommams, but adventure.) Unmarried males form the backbone of the military forces, and more than a few become adventurers.

As the grommams make their homes in forests, they climb extremely well and some build treehouses, but most grommams are ground dwellers. They enjoy the same climates as humans. They have no trouble eating human food.

Grommam spelljamming ships (usually purchased from humans) are decorated with bright colors and wild designs. Because grommams are so adept at climbing, they make heavy use of ropes and swing bars in their rigging.

Grommams communicate by using gestures and finger-sign language. Body postures, facial expressions, and a variety of vocal hoots, screams, grunts, and calls add to the basic language, called "grommish" by other races.

Grommams prefer to wear loose, brightly colored clothing, particularly short-sleeved kimonos. They are fond of belts, arm straps, and leg straps, to which they attach weapons and tools that are tied down.

### Grommam Names:
Grommams names are, like grommish, largely nonverbal. However, for the sake of other races, they usually adopt short, simple human names when speaking other languages.

**Male Names:** Joe, Kong, Igor, Charles, Elmer

**Female Names:** Eva, Lola, Nonna, Trudy

## Hadozee

<img src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/a/af/Hadozee3eB.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180715134227' style='mix-blend-mode:multiply;width:280px' />

Hadozee, or "deck apes," are tall, slender, tailless apelike humanoids. They are covered with brown hair, including a shaggy mane that surrounds their face. The hadozee mouth is a protruding muzzle with several long fangs. Hadozee have a broad flap of skin that runs from the creatures arms to its legs. This flap can be drawn tight by raising the arms, giving the hadozee a limited gliding ability.

Hadozee are rude, reserving their coarse commentary only in the presence of elves and the hadozee's employers. When outside these controlling influences, however, they can utter a continuous stream of insults and derision, with tongues sharp enough to make the most seasoned spelljammer take notice.  However, the hadozee are extremely diligent workers and are respected throughout the Known Spheres for their willingness to work as hard as is needed to get the job done. They do not shirk their responsibilities in combat, either, and most hadozee work both as crewmen and as mercenaries. Surprisingly, most Hadozee are quite easygoing, when one can get over their rough language. They are very difficult to insult themselves, and usually don't hold grudges for long.

Hadozee prefer to join the crews of other nations. They are particularly fond of elves as employers. A group of young adult hadozee sign on with a single captain, training together and forming a traveling company of 20-30 individuals. Hadozee tend to be egalitarian in terms of gender, considering the thought of treating others differently for it ridiculous.

The Hadozee have a number of gods, which are mostly venerated on their homeworld. Hadozee in wildspace tend to adopt local deities, whom they see as aspects of their own powers; most adventuring deck apes venerate powers of luck, skill, combat, and travel.

The hadozee homeworld is temperate and warm, and has a climate like that of most human worlds. Hadozee generally wear no clothing (except in cold weather), as most clothing would interfere with their gliding membranes. They wear special caftans with slit sides on ceremonial occasions, or when in an unfamiliar port.


### Hadozee Names
Hadozee names are usually short, often monosyllabic. They are not gendered. In contrast to these short names, clan names are often highly prosaic.

**Names:** Tuk, Konn, Koto, Kuv, Tro

**Clan Names:** Cloudjumper, Dawnchaser

***Natural Acrobat.*** You gain proficiency in the Acrobatics skill.

***Language.*** The hadozee language sounds quite harsh, having a large number of hard consonants. Most hadozee are capable of spewing forth insults in almost any other language they have come in contact with. You can speak, read, and write Hadozee, Elvish, and Common.

## Hurwaeti
The hurwaeti, also known as wiggles, are an ancient reptilian race distantly related to both sahuagin and lizardfolk.. They are basically humanoid, with small, thick, olivegreen scales, long froglike legs, and webbed fingers and toes. Their gnomelike faces have large ears, pointed noses, and sharp bearded chins. They favor simple clothing—usually long, brightly colored loin cloths—and jewelery made from ceramics or shells.

Hurwaeti prefer seafood but can eat anything humans can (plus a few things humans can't—or won't)

Like their distant cousins, the lizard men and the sahuagin, hurwaeti reproduce by laying eggs. However, the male hurwaet scoops up the eggs as soon as they are laid and places them inside a special pouch in his abdomen, where the eggs incubate for about eight months before hatching. This habit usually makes it difficult for non-hurwaeti to tell the males from the females.

Hurwaeti are greedy but nonaggressive. Nobody gets anything from a hurwaet for free, but the hurwaeti don't expect
anything for free either.

Hurwaeti tribes are made up of clans, each ruled by an elder. The senior clan head — usually the oldest and wealthiest — governs the tribe. All disputes within the tribe are settled by appealing to the tribal chief. When a chief dies, a new chief is chosen by election from among the clan elders. Young hurwaeti gain wealth and status by serving on their clan ships or by venturing forth independently.

Hurwaeti usually crew other races' ships. Their own ships use series helms, as the hurwaeti have no mages or clerics. Most hurwaeti ships are salvaged derelicts, cast-off ships from another race restored and refitted for hurwaeti use. Some few ships are hurwaeti-built; these resemble those built by lizardfolk.

The hurwaeti were once a great spacefaring race that had colonized many systems, spreading art, civilization, morality, and an philosophy favoring altruism and discipline throughout the spheres. But an ancient war broke up their empire and killed the brightest and most energetic individuals. The destruction stranded the hurwaeti colonists, leaving them to degenerate into the swamp and salt wiggles. The remaining spacefarers became impoverished wanderers, content to simply earn a living for themeselves and their tribes.

 Their greatest hatred is reserved for beholders, illithids, and neogi, probably because of the ancient war. A hurwaet will never surrender to a member of these races, preferring to fight until death.

### Hurwaeti Names
Hurwaeti commonly adopt lizardfolk names, but they do have a few unique names of their own left over from the ancient days. Other races commonly perceive hurwaeti mens names to be feminine and vice versa, but the hurwaeti do not.

**Male Names:**  Aevia, Mitia, Uella, Vida

**Female Names:** Aemin, Siert, Kuess, Oedo

```
```

### Hurwaeti Traits

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Hurwaeti mature faster than humans, but are far more long-lived. They reach adulthood around age 12 and can live up to 300 years.

***Alignment.*** Hurwaeti are generally self-interested, but they mostly tend to avoid  outright evil. They are usually neutral, leaning more towards law than chaos.

***Size.*** Hurwaeti average between 6 and 7 feet tall, weighing between 190 and 230 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Natural Leaper.*** Your frog-like legs make you a powerful jumper. Your long jump is up to 20 ft. and your high jump is up to 10 ft., with or without a running start.

***Fog Cloud.*** You can produce the effect of the spell *fog cloud* once per day. This is a natural process and is not affected by *dispel magic* , but it can still dispersed by strong winds. Multiple hurwaeti working together can produce enough oxygen to last a day in wildspace.

***Natural Armor.*** You have thick, smooth, glossy scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

***Language.*** The hurwaeti speak a slightly altered dialect of draconic, close enough to be understood by other draconic speakers and vice versa. You can speak, read, and write Draconic and Common.

## Illithid

### Outcast
You are an outcast, and serve no elder brain colony. In Wildspace where distances are huge, this is not a totally uncommon incident.

### Shunned, but powerful
Other people don't really like Illithid, but most will respect you out of fear.

### Illithid Traits

As an Illithid you gain the following traits

**Ability scores.** Your intelligence increases by 2.

**Languages.** Deep Speech, Undercommon, Telepathy 60 ft (see below).

**Telepathy.** You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself. Creatures without telepathy can receive and respond to these telepathic messages but can't initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to the depths of the Space and the Underdark, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Menacing.** You are trained in the Intimidation skill.

**Mind Flayer Resistance.** You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.

**Tentacles.** You can use your action to attempt to grapple a creature within 5 feet of you with your tentacles. On a success, you also deal psychic damage equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier, and you can't use your tentacles on another target until the grapple ends. Additionally, you can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by your tentacles. When you do so, the creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the creature is stunned until the start of your next turn, and both you and the creature are restrained until the grapple ends.

**Extract Brain.** If you kill a creature with your tentacles during a grapple, you can consume the fresh brain and sense the mire of it's fleeting emotions and thoughts. While consuming a fresh brain you can perform a Intelligence (Investigation) check DC 15 to learn one piece of simple information, typically less than 10 words, from the brain. The brain only knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive. The brain can't maintain a conversation, and it can't speculate about future events.

## Rastipedes
Rastipedes are insectoid centaurs with eight walking limbs and a vaguely humanoid torso with two upper "arms," all covered in a chitinous exoskeleton. Their heads have two large compound eyes, a chitinous mandible, and a pair of long, whiplike antennae. Rastipedes are born from eggs, which are laid by a queen that reputedly lives deep within ground in a secluded cavern, wherever they creatures have nests. Rastipedes grow up with a strong sense of duty and responsibility to the nest and the community. AIl rastipedes are well taught in the literature of their own race, which is quite extensive, and mathematics. Some slothful rastipedes wish to escape from the rigid structure of the nest, and so they seek adventure where they can use their natural abilities to great effect. Many of them go on to become bards, taking advantage of their innate charisma.

Rastipedes are inherently peaceful and avoid combat whenever possible. However, they are not cowardly and can (and do) use the full range of weapons usable by humans.

Rastipedes are the penultimate traders of the Known Spheres. Only the Arcane are more willing to exchange valuable goods, but the rastipedes seem unconcerned with such niceties as uniform pricing and fair dealing. A spacefarer who makes a deal with a rastipede is advised to count his money, his crew, and his limbs.

Rastipedes are not truly dishonest, however. They rarely renege on a bargain once struck, and as a rule they deliver their side of the bargain at the time and place specified. The problem is that the rastipedes delight in meeting the letter of the bargain, rather than the spirit. They are particularly fond of making a deal knowing that the other party is assuming something that is not true. They will sell you a lottery ticket with this week's winning numbers on it—but it will be last week's ticket. Rastipedes will buy and sell anything they think will be profitable, although most scrupulously obey smuggling and slave-trafficking laws.

This propensity for hard bargaining has brought the rastipedes in contact with the Arcane. In fact, rastipedes are favored henchmen of these mysterious traders. Very often, characters who seek an Arcane find themselves dealing with a rastipede go-between. Rumors suggest a darker, more sinister connection between the two races, but there is no evidence to indicate that any such association exists.

### Rastipede Names
Rastipedes earn names that are indicative of their productivity to the nest. Such names are more a matter of status. Rastipedes can also earn names due to important jobs they do such as forager  or bloodspiller . To these names of status or positions all rastipedes carry the nest name, which seem to be used only when rastipedes meet other rastipedes from another nest.

**Names of Nests:** Aphidgarden, Goldhill, Water Raiders

***Age:*** Rastipedes mature slowly, reaching adulthood at around age 25 and living up to 200 years.

***Alignment.*** Rastipedes are, traditionally, more devoted to order and the letter of the law than anything else, being almost exclusively lawful neutral. However, exceptions to this rule are also the most likely to break away from the nest and become adventurers.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 35 feet.

## Scro
The scro are a muscular humanoid race; they resemble orcs, but are larger, stronger, and more intelligent. They average 6' in height, with long, sharp teeth filed to a point and inscribed with various symbols and inset with tiny gems. Their skins vary in color from jet black to burnt orange, with various shades of grey, tan, and green in between. Their eyes have a phosphorescent glow which can be seen in dim light.

The scro are a military-minded people, as much so as the giff. Their entire lives are oriented around the military hierarchy, with larger and more powerful scro at the highest levels. However, where the giff serve their military hierarchy to pursue glory and fame, the scro seek mayhem, destruction, and the devastation of their enemies. Scro society is codified in a rigid set of laws and customs laid down by the founder of scro society: Dukgash, the first Almighty Leader. The spartan life-style that this code permits is oriented toward improving the mind and body so that victory can be achieved.

The scro trace their ancestry back to the orc tribes that fought and lost the Unhuman Wars.  This ragtag band was led by a huge orc called Dukagsh, who appointed himself the first Almighty Leader.

By orc standards, Dukagsh was a visionary. He recognized that the orcs lost the Unhuman Wars because of their one-dimensional ideas and outmoded tactics. Brutality for its own sake had gotten them nowhere. Dukagsh realized that the orcs needed to fight in an organized way, and that each soldier must realize his full potential. In the ensuing years, Dukagsh whipped his people into shape, making sure that they learned fighting, survival, and even culture. To make sure no one forgot who caused the orcs’ misfortune, each orc had to learn fluent elvish. Sometime, the orcs salvaged equipment from drifting space junk, the remains of human, elven, dwarven, and goblinoid ships from the Unhuman War battles. Occasionally they found books, and Dukagsh made his people read them.

Before Dukagsh died, he declared that his people were on the path to success. The old ways were dead, he claimed, and a new race was born, a race that was more than any orc could ever be. He named them the scro.

Scro spelljamming vessels are invariably warships. Their shipboard weapons are oriented for quickly grappling with enemy ships so that hand-to-hand combat can begin. Scro consider it to be especially glorious to kill an enemy with their teeth, and will often finish off wounded foes with a savage bite. While the scro are excellent strategists, and they do use ranged weapons, their preference for close combat often leads them to make costly heavy assaults rather than sniping attacks. Strangely, the scro are notably articulate. They prefer to begin combat by shouting long, literate insults against their opponents, to show that they hold their enemies in contempt.

Currently, scro are rare among the Known Spheres. Their homeworld is not known, and contact with them has been sporadic, but usually violent.

The scro led the other humanoids in the recent Second Unhuman War, and their goal seems to be nothing short of destroying all elves and conquering the Known Spheres, driving all groundling human, demi-human, and humanoid races out of wildspace for good. The war priests see this, not planetary conquest, as their holy mission. As for the races native to wildspace… well, the scro will need slave labor, and those pitiful races will do quite nicely. The scro are merely waiting for the right moment to strike.

### Scro Names
Scro names tend to be mostly identical to orc names, with very minor variations. Many are named Dukagsh, after the first Almighty Leader.

\page

### Scro Traits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Scro are longer-lived than their orcish ancestors, reaching adulthood at around age 12 and on average living to be about 85.

***Alignment.*** The scro are dedicated to the military hierarchy and law, rejecting the disorganized raiding of their ancestors. They are usually lawful evil.

***Size.*** Scro are larger than their ancestors, usually standing between 6 and 7 feet tall, usually weighing between 250 and 290 pounds.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of grey.

***Bite.***  Your sharp teeth, filed to a deadly point, are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4+ your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Powerful Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

***Forward March.*** As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed towards an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.

***Language.***
The scro speak a twisted, ancient version of orc. They also know elvish; this is so they can tell the elves who is destroying them when the time comes. You can speak, read, and write Orc, Elvish, and Common.

## Spaceborn Lizardfolk
It is thought that the first lizardfolk in space were slaves of humans or mind flayers. They proved very fertile in space, and their descendants benefited from their escape from the planets. These lizardfolk were smarter, faster, and more adaptable than their slave parents. Some think this was a response to their enslavement, but the lizardfolk believe that it was due to their new existence in space, and the close passes to the various suns.

There is some truth to this idea, in that lizardfolk who developed on planets closer to the sun were marginally smarter than the ones farther away, but the difference was found more in tactics than in heavy thinking. The spaceborn lizardfolk gained levels of both civilization and communication unmatched by their groundling cousins.

The lizardfolk society in space is founded on the principle of bringing more intelligent lizardfolk into the world. They have incubator ships whose purpose is to bring the eggs close to the sun. The neogi have on a number of occasions captured these ships to create a new generation of slaves, so the lizardfolk now go armed.

Intelligent lizardfolk are still short-tempered and emotional--- their newfound statuts is still relatively recent. They use human ships, modified by their own use, to travel in space, but they have sun-worshipping clerics generally of the Light or Life domains, druids, and (very rarely) other spellcasters such as wizards or bards that may power their major or minor helms.
```

<div style=margin-top:80px></div>

### Spaceborn Lizardfolk Traits
Spaceborn lizardfolk use the lizardfolk traits presented in *Volo's Guide To Monsters,* with the following changes:

***Age.*** Spaceborn lizardfolk are far longer-lived than their groundling counterparts, reaching adulthood around age 14, and living up to 370 years or so.

***Spacer's Lore.*** You gain proficiency with Navigators Tools, and you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Athletics, Perception, Stealth, Intimidation, and Survival. This replaces Hunter's Lore.

***Cunning Repairer.*** Your natural ingenuity allows you to make makeshift repairs during expeditions, even while the ship is in motion. Repairing 1 hit point of damage requires 1 day and 20 gp for materials, or 2 days with no gp cost if you have access to a forest or other source of unclaimed timber. This replaces Cunning Artisan.

## Xixchil
Xixchil are six-limbed insectoid beings with body structures much like that of a praying mantis. Their forward limbs are long and hook-like, with sharp retractable blades, while their center pair of limbs are smaller, and are often fitted with delicate mechanical manipulators. The xixchil decorate themselves through surgical modification. A typical xixchil will have gems, jewels, and precious metals fitted to its exo-skeleton and formed into exquisite shapes, allowing each xixchil to be a nearly unique being.

Xixchil evolved on a liveworld among many predators. Their modification ability enabled them to grow defensive weapons and camouflage. Aided by their unique metabolism, they poisoned and slashed their way to the top of the food chain. Since danger was ever-present in xixchil life, females spun egg cases containing 100 eggs. When they hatched, the young killed and ate each other until one or two individuals remained. After the first week of life, the infants’ homicidal tendencies faded, allowing the xixchil to achieve civilization. This inborn winnowing process still occurs today. The overriding xixchil philosophy is "survival of the fittest." Each individual is expected to improve itself through study and
surgical modification.

This philosophy extends to xixchil morality as well. An individual's allegiance is first to itself, then to its family, and finally to society. Xixchil adventurers will sometimes accord their party-mates the status of "family," but the xixchil are rarely willing to sacrifice themselves to help even then. Adventuring xixchil wander the universe, seeking ever more prestige through experience and discovering more and more utilitarian "treasures." The xixchil find as much beauty in an efficient killing machine as a dwarf does in a well-fashioned piece of jewelry.

The xixchil talent for surgical adornment has found many applications among non-xixchil as well. These “adornments” have earned these surgeons a mixed reputation among their clients, for humanoid aesthetics mean nothing to the xixchil. They believe that form follows function, which has led to some really unhappy customers – for instance, the dwarf who wanted superhuman strength, so the xixchil surgeon modified him to use it. Who needs a head, the surgeon reasoned, except for use as a muscle anchor?  Tales such as these have made many quietly fearful of the xixchil, and they are not entirely unwarranted.

As an aside, this penchant for adornment also extends to lower animal and plant life. Blooming birds and winged kittens are common sale items. Xixchil spelljamming ships are prime examples of plant sculpture, sporting orchid-like blooms as gangways, exotic naturally-grown staterooms, and sail-like leaves. The introduction of these non-intelligent spacegoing beauties has caused consternation among the elves, since they rival the elven ships in quality but are easier to maintain.

### Xixchil Names
Most xixchil who deal with humans are named after their first “modification.” These names are, of course, not gendered, and the xixchil do not believe in surnames.

**Names:** Gem, Hook, Spinner, Spike, Scalpel, Rivet, Arm

```
```

### Xixchil Traits

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score decreases by 2.

***Age.*** Xixchil reach adulthood at around age 16, and unadorned can live to be up to 200, though battle-hardened tend to live to be only about 100.

***Alignment.*** Their selfish attitude means good xixchil are nearly unheard of, but overall they are more commonly neutral than evil with no tendency towards law or chaos.

***Size.*** Xixchil usually stand between 5 and 7 feet tall, weighing between 140 and 180 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base land speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of grey.

***Exoskeleton.*** When you aren't wearing armor or using a shield, your AC is 14 + your Dexterity modifier.  You cannot wear armor, as your body shape is simply incompatible with humanoid armors.

***Mandible and Claw.*** Your hooked, bladed arms and sharp mandibles are both natural finesse weapons, which you can use to make an unarmed strike. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, or piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Weak Arms.*** Your main set of arms is blade-like and lacks hands, essentially useless for anything but slashing. Your second, smaller set of arms is capable of delicate work like writing, lifting small objects, or needlework, but lacks raw strength. You cannot wield melee or two-handed weapons or use shields.

***Languages.*** The xixchil communicate among themselves with a complex language of both gestures and spoken words punctuated with sharp clicks of their mandibles. The xixchil mandibles are so complex that they can be used to form the words of humanoid speech. You can speak, read, and write Xixchil and Common.

***Subrace.*** The two main types of xixchil, unadorned and battle-hardened, are distinguished by the purposes of their surgical modifications. Choose one of these subraces.

<div class='footnote'>PART 8 | XIXCHIL</div>
\page

### Unadorned Xixchil
Your modifications were mainly minor or decorative, such as jewelry, tattoos, or scalpels, leaving your fine motor control and internal organs intact, including those used to produce poison. Additionally, you have some training in surgery and the medical arts and you can create an enzyme that stabilizes those on the brink of death.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

***Natural Poison.*** If you have tasted a creatures blood, either by making a successful bite attack against it or licking it from your claws, you can synthesize a poison specific to that creature and apply it to either your mandibles or your claws as a bonus action. The next time you hit that creature with it before the end of your turn, it deals an extra 1d4 poison damage. The damage increases to 2d4 at 6th level, 3d4 at 11th level, and 4d4 at 16th level. Additionally, you can spend 10 minutes to create a creature-specific anesthetic. If applied within one minute of creation by way of either a bite attack or willing consumption of the anesthetic, the creature must make a DC 8 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 hours. A willing creature, such as a patient, may choose to automatically fail this saving throw. You can only synthesize a poison or anesthetic once per short or long rest.

***Surgeon.*** You gain proficiency in the Medicine skill, and you know the *spare the dying* cantrip.

```
```

### Battle-Hardened Xixchil
When a xixchil pursues a life of combat it purchases body modifications – special limbs in the form of maces, blowguns, swords, glaives, or other weapons. These xixchil graft rivets into their exoskeletons and surgically grow an extra set of "arms," in truth powerfully muscled stumps which weapons may be attached to, becoming killing machines at the cost of many of their "redundant" organs, such as those used to synthesize poison, and their fine motor control, which is generally dulled, though not lost entirely.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2.

***Weapon-Arms.*** You have two powerful arm stumps, which you can affix weapons or a shield to. During a short or long rest, you may attach two one-handed weapons, a one-handed weapon and a shield, or a two-handed weapon. You cannot be disarmed of these by anything short of the removal of your arm.

***Rivets.*** During a short or long rest, you may  graft a suit of armor to your body by way of rivets in your exoskeleton. When you finish that rest, the armor you are wearing is grafted to you, and it cannot subsequently be removed from your body until you finish another short rest during which time you remove the grafted armor.

***Optimized Immune System.*** The organs you "need" have been enhanced, and those you don't removed. You can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes, and once per short or long rest you can give yourself advantage on a Constitution saving throw.

### Optional Feat
If your DM allows the use of feats from chapter 6 of the *Player's Handbook,* your xixchil character has access to the following special feat.

#### Xixchil Body Modification
*Prerequisite: Xixchil*

Taking advantage of your delicate hands and racial aptitude for body modification, you may perform a number of operations. Performing an operation takes one hour for every 50 GP it costs.

Simple operations simply take time and gold, with no risk of injury, while complicated procedures carry the risk of permanent injury and guaranteed disfigurement. Whenever you perform a complicated procedure on a creature, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or roll for a lingering injury, rerolling results of 11-13. This save is made at disadvantage if the patient is not unconscious. Regardless of whether or not that creature passes or fails this save, it suffers the effects of the *Horrible Scar* lasting injury, as the results are never pretty.

 No creature may have more than one complicated procedure active at a time, and magic such as *heal* or *regenerate* will undo the procedure in addition to any lingering injuries it causes. Here are a few examples of simple and complicated procedures, though at your DM's discretion you may be able to perform various others.

<div style='margin-top:100px'></div>

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/sCBrMyh.png' style='width:280px' />

```
```
<br>

<div style='margin-top:100px'></div>

##### Simple Procedures
| Price (GP) | Procedure  |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 5  | Piercing |
| 50   | Tattoo |
| 200 | Eye color change |
| 300 | Hair color change |
| 1,250 | Facial restructuring |
| 1,400 | Height increase (6 inches) |
| 2,000 | Height decrease (6 inches) |
| 2,000 | Gender affirming surgery |

##### Complicated Procedures
| Price (GP) | Procedure |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 5,000  | Darkvision |
| 7,000  | Natural weapon
| 9,000 | Natural armor |
| 15,000  | Wings |



***Darkvision.*** You gain disturbing, bloodshot eyes oddly similar to those of a dark elf or deep gnome, granting you darkvision of 120 feet.


***Wings.*** You gain wings, perhaps bat-like but for the color of the skin, perhaps patchily feathered, granting you a flight speed of 40 feet.

***Natural Weapon.*** Your teeth and claws are lengthened and sharpened to an unnatural, off-putting point. They are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing or slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Natural Armor.*** Your skin thickens, with patches of strange rhinoceros-like skin replacing fur, or your chitin becomes hard and visibly secretes a strange oil. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

# Spells
This chapter offers new spells for many of the classes in the Player's Handbook. The spells provide various way to harness the power of Wildspace and The Phlogiston. Your DM determines whether these spells are available at character creation, whether they are discovered drifting in the ruins of wrecked vessels, or whether you stumble upon them in an ancient library or other storehouse of magical knowledge.

##### 1st Level
Create or Destroy Air (Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger)

##### 2nd Level
Portal Magic (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

##### 3rd Level
Contact Home Power (Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger)

##### 4th Level
Softwood (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger)

##### 5th Level
Create Helm (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)


#### Create or Destroy Air
*1st level Transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 100 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (A small, stoppered flask)

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You either create or destroy air.

*Create Air*

You replace, replenish, and refresh the air in a personal air envelope for 10 minutes for any creature within range, including air poisoned/tained by spells such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud. This does not create a larger in size envelope, but simply replenishes the air in the envelope that the creature drags with it. If the air is fouled, the air turns fresh again and the air timer resets to 10 minutes. If used within a spell or effect that causes a cloud (similar to the Fog Cloud, Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud spells) the creature is allowed an immediate save against the effects of the spell.

*Destroy Air*

The air envelope of a target creature within range immediately is reduced to Fouled status, with all effects of Fouled status. If air is already Fouled status, this spell has no effect.

**At higher levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you may target one additional creature for each slot above 1st.

```
```

#### Portal Magic
*2nd level Divination (Ritual)*

**Casting time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Half a mile

**Components:** V, S, M (A conch shell)

**Duration:** 1 minute

Casting out to the very Crystal Shell itself, you can sense the direction and distance (either in miles or in travel time) of the nearest portal of egress through a Crystal Shell.

In general, from any point on a Crystal Shell, naturally occurring portals for a ship are 2d10 days away. At DM’s discretion, there may be more, less, or no portals.

This spell may only be cast within half a mile of the surface of a Crystal Shell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you may draw a circle in the air towards the Crystal Shell. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open for five minutes. The opening does not weaken the shell, and any objects resting physically on the shell are unaffected by the portal.

Portals created by this spell are magical and temporary, so they can be dispelled. If the portal is dispelled or otherwise prematurely closed, roll 1d10, and determine the result the fate of the object(s) passing through the opening as it closes:

1-5: Portal closes before ship reaches the shell. Ship must turn back using a Stunt, or Crash into the shell.

6-10: Portal closes after ship passes through.

#### Contact Home Power
*3rd level Conjuration (Ritual)*

**Casting time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (A small toy horn, to be blown)

**Duration:** One week, or until you leave the current Crystal Shell

You mentally establishes a tenuous link through the Astral Plane between your present location and that of the power you receive guidance from. This link permits the Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, and Warlock to regain spells above 3rd level as if their divine link was revered in the Crystal Sphere they currently reside.

Distance has no effect upon the attempt to contact the home power, but dimensional gates, anti-magic fields, and the effects of dispel magic will prevent the use of the spell. Additionally, the spell will not function in areas that power has been specifically banished from (whether from Banishment or some previous action by the power itself).

If power is forbidden, the caster will be informed through the spell that such contact is forbidden, but not the reason why. Passage into another plane, or into the ethereal will break the connection. While the spell is in effect, the caster will react positively to a Detect Magic spell.

The spell cannot be cast in the Phlogiston.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
\page

#### Softwood
*4th level Transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of tree bark)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into a soft, spongy lump of wood, similar to that of a rotting stump.

The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to grow mossy and brown. On a successful save, the creature isn’t affected. A creature restrained by this spell may make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails saves three times, it is turned to softwood and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw.

The softwood lump is immune to all damage. A character turned to softwood could fall to Earth and the heat and impact of the fall would be absorbed by the spell.

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to softwood until the effect is removed., or until the target is brought into contact with open air for 30 minutes, such as the air on a planetoid or ship.

#### Create Minor Helm
*5th level Enchantment (Ritual)*

**Casting time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (Chair, stool, or other seat-like object)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

By casting this spell on a normal chair or other seat, this spell transforms that chair or seat into a Minor Spelljammer Helm suitable for powering a Spelljamming ship. The Helm this spell creates provides a Helm rating of 1:3, similar to a Minor Helm. If this Helm is dispelled, the chair or other seat used for the Material component of this spell is destroyed.

You can Create a permanent Helm by casting this spell on the same seat-like object every day for one year. You need not use the Helm this spell creates when you cast the spell this way.

```
```

#### Awaken Ship
*8th level Transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 day

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V S M (An agate worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Classes:** Bard, Druid

After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a living spelljammer ship. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. It can communicate telepathically with anyone abord the ship, and genuinely wants to assist the crew.


The awakened ship is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.

#### Create Major Helm
*8th level Enchantment (Ritual)*

**Casting time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (Chair, stool, or other seat-like object)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

By casting this spell on a normal chair or other seat, this spell transforms that chair or seat into a Major Spelljammer Helm suitable for powering a Spelljamming ship. The Helm this spell creates provides a Helm rating of 1:2, similar to a Major Helm. If this Helm is dispelled, the chair or other seat used for the Material component of this spell is destroyed.

You can Create a permanent Helm by casting this spell on the same seat-like object every day for one year. You need not use the Helm this spell creates when you cast the spell this way.



#### Chill Fire
*3rd level transmutation*

**Casting time:** 1 action

**Range:**	Self (120 foot sphere)

**Components:**	V, S, M (a sliver of glass or ice)

**Duration:**	10 minutes

You create an area around yourself that reduces the dangers of fire in the Phlogiston. When the spell is cast it reduces to the damage caused by fire in the Phlogiston to its normal damage. This affects both magical and mundane fires.

# Tools for Universe Builders

Traveling in a straight line, Spelljamming ships can attain extremely high velocity relatively quickly, spanning the great emptiness between planets in a short time. On the other hand, planets and other space-bourne bodies move relatively slow; so slowly that they can be thought of as being a fixed point on a map, similar to a town on any overworld map you may have seen previously. You can think of mapping the star chart of Wildspace itself similarly to a massive Dungeon as well; treating rooms as stars and planets, rubble as asteroid fields, stairs as wormholes, etc. This chapter will help you create the star systems to fill your campaigns.

Whether operating under Newtonian physics, riding on the back of giant turtles, or rolling across a velvet pool table of the gods, most planets behave in a similar fashion. There are systems where the planets operate in a totally chaotic manner, as well as those where the planets are truly unmoving points in the night sky. There are crystal shells so small that they contain only a single world. There are shells which contain one single flat disk that extends to the very edges of the sphere, and spheres which may contain more spheres. Most systems have a central fire world (think *Sol*, the star of our solar system), and all planets will be rotating around that central fire world. Use the rules below to help create the Crystal Shells in your game.

## Creating your Universe

Use the tables below to create a planetary system from scratch; there are seven steps:

1. **Type of System:** Is it a standard system (planets orbiting around a central point), or special system?
2. **Primary Body:** What is the primary body, for which all planets orbit around? (Planet, Black Hole, etc)
3. **Number of planets:** How many main planets orbit the primary body?
4. **Orbits and Placement:** What are the orbital rings of each body? Where are they located relative to each other?
5. For each body:
* What is its **size**?
* What is its **type**?
* What is its **shape**?
* Any other **notes**: such as moons or inhabitants?
6. **Population and Technology Level:** Is there any civilization? Do some or all of the civilizations in this area have Spelljamming capabilities?
7. **Distance:** What is the distance to the Crystal Shell of the system? (twice the orbit of the furthest major body)

```
```

The type of system you create guides the rest of this section, and will determine the overall structure of the galaxy contained within a Crystal Shell. After this step, proceed through the rest of the steps to determine the makeup of your randomly generated star system.

### 1. Type of system

| D10  | Type  |
|:---|:-----------:|
| 1-7 | Standard System |
| 8-10 | Special System; Roll another 1d10 and use result below |
|  | **Special Systems** |
|  1-2 | Fixed System; Planets don't rotate around central point |
|  3-4 | Chaotic/Random movement |
|  5-6 | Semi-random movement |
|  7-8 | Strange; See note below |
|    9 | Void (Nothing; or debris); Stop rolling |
|   10 | Nested Spheres; After creating the first system, create another to determine second system |

<br>In the case of a *Strange* roll, use your imagination and speak to your players to come up with what the sphere contains.

In the case of a *Void* roll, don't assume a "Void" as lacking story elements. An entire Crystal Sphere of planet debris definitely has a story to tell . . .

This is not an exhaustive list; Your sphere could contain Planets mounted on enormous clockwork gears, spinning indefinitely; Planets eternally tumbling down a hill; Planets on the backs of titans; Planets nestled as berries in an enormous tree; or on the pool table/chess board of the gods and titans themselves.

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/JIbLHii.png' style='position:absolute;top:0px;right:0px;height:100%;' />

### 2. Primary Body

|**D10**|**Body**|
|:-----:|:-----:|
|1-6|Fire body (like the Sun)|
|7|Earth body (like Earth)|
|8|Wind body (like a Gas Giant)
|9|Water bodies (like a planet of mostly ocean or ice)|
|10|Special (Roll on table below)|
|**D10**|**Special**|
|1|Portal to Outer Plane|
|2|Portal to Plane of Elemental Fire|
|3|Portal to Plane of Elemental Earth|
|4|Portal to Plane of Elemental Water|
|5|Portal to Plane of Elemental Air|
|6|Portal to Positive Material Plane|
|7|Portal to Negative Material Plane|
|8|1d4 Primary Bodies|
|9|Portal to another shell|
|10|Liveworld|

The Primary Body of a Crystal Shell is the central point of a Crystal Sphere. Think of this like a star. Usually, it is a fire body like the Sun of our solar system, but other possibilities may occur that can be interesting points in your campaign.

A Liveworld is a living being, the size of a planet, that sits as the center of a Crystal Sphere.

If a Portal to an Outer Plane is rolled, Roll 1d8 and use the chart below to determine the plane that exists on the other end of the portal. Optionally, the DM may create a plane of her choosing.

|**D8**|**Result**|
|:-----:|:-----:|
|1|Abaddon - Lawful Evil|
|2|Avalon - Lawful Good|
|3|Duma - Neutral Evil|
|4|Malebolge - Chaotic Evil|
|5|Nirvana - Neutral Good|
|6|Purgatory - Lawful Neutral|
|7|Valhalla - Chaotic Good|
|8|Vigrond - Chaotic Neutral|

You can read more about other Planes by referring to the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, Chapter 2.


### 3. Number of Planets

Roll 2d10 to determine the number of planets in the system. You may also choose to replace one of the planets with an asteroid field.

You may want to have more planets or a single planet in the system you create. The DM is advised to use her discretion in determining how many planets each galaxy contains - too many planets may be difficult to keep track of.
```
```
 <div style="margin-top:480px;"></div>
### 4. Orbits and Placement

Standard systems orbiting around a Primary body have a perfectly circular orbit (This is to keep with our simple random generation theme). In order to place our planets in this system easily, we have 100 circular "rings", stepping increasingly away from the Primary Body in 50 million mile (A half-days of travel) increments; Planets and other space-bourne bodies can only appear on these rings, and the rings represent their orbital trajectory around the Primary Body.

A Spelljamming ship in Wildspace travels at 100 million miles in a 24 hour period (about 4 million miles per hour). This means that, from the Primary Body to the closest point on the first "ring", it will take 12 hours of uninterrupted travel in a Spelljamming ship. From the Primary Body to the closest point of the final "ring" (Ring number 100), it takes 50 days of uninterrupted travel in a Spelljamming ship.

For each of the planets created, roll a D100 to determine what ring you will place it on. If you roll the same number twice, you can choose to either re-roll or move the planet to an adjacent ring. Keep in mind that familiarity breeds contempt, and neighboring planets may not be on the best of terms . . .

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
\page

<img src='https://wallup.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/308627-planet-landing-science_fiction-wizard-assassins-mountain-sea-stars.jpg' style='position:absolute;bottom:-80px;left:0px;width:110%;'/>

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/XzbbBU4.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:235px;left:0px;width:100%;transform:rotate(180deg)'>

Planets rotating around a Primary Body aren't always in perfect alignment and right next to one-another for simple travel. Earth and Mars are sometimes on opposite sides of the Sun, so to travel from the Earth to Mars will take time to reach the Sun, and then more time to reach Mars. You can determine the positions of your planets upon creation of the galaxy by dividing all rings into eight separate sections. Draw 6 separate, equally spaced straight lines extending outwards from the Primary Body, like lines extending from a central point to the points of a hexagon. Numbering them in successive order, roll 1d6 for each planet or other space-bourne body to determine which section the planet starts in on the ring.

Optionally, the DM may rotate their planets around the central body if the campaign lasts for a extended time -- Rings 1 - 25 complete a rotation around the central body in half a standard Earth year, rings 26-50 take one standard Earth year, rings 51-75 take a standard Earth year and a half, and rings 76-100 take two standard Earth years.

It's generally advised to use the average distance when informing players of travel time between two space-bourne bodies, to keep things simple. The average relative travel time between the Earth and Mars would be relayed as 34 hours, or just under a day and a half. Optionally, the furthest or closest distance that the planets could be on their rotation could be taken into account when determining travel distance. For example, the closest distance from Earth to Mars would take as little as 8.5 hours of travel in a Spelljamming vessel whereas farthest distance would take 2.5 days in a Spelljamming vessel. That may be a lot to keep track of, so make a decision and stick with what you are comfortable with.

You may also choose to have these planets orbit on more than or less than circular orbital trajectory, similarly to real life (also giving a scientific evidence to the reason for seasons). For ease of calculating distances with this option, the ellipses you create will still step out from the Primary Body. The distance to the closest point will be half that of a perfect circle, and the distance to the farthest point will be double that of a perfect circle.

```
```

For example, the closest point of the first ellipse will take merely 6 hours to reach by Spelljamming vessel, but the farthest point in the first ellipse will take a full day's travel (24 hours). Likewise the closest point on ellipse number 100 will take 25 days to reach, but the farthest point will take 100 days to reach.

### 5. Planet statistics

There are six sizes of Celestial bodies, listed as Size A through F. They are referred to as Tiny (A), Small (B), Medium (C), Large (D), Huge (E), and Gargantuan (F).

Earth, and most Earth-like fantasy campaigns, are Size C.

A Celestial body containing a gravity well and/or atmosphere is any body of 10 tons or greater space displacement (300 cubic feet, or a cube slightly less than 14 feet on a side). Small items such as Rowboats and Elvish Flitters which rate under 10 tons do not have this effect. The bright star at the very center is a planet of pure fire. The block of ice on the outermost edge is also a planet. The systems you generate do not have to make sense in a "Goldilocks Zone" fashion.

Roll 1d6 on the table below to determine planet size:

##### Celestial Body Size Categories

|1d6|**Class**|**Measurement**|
|:-:|:-----|:-----|
|1|Size A|Less than 100 miles across
|2|Size B|101-10,000 miles across
|3|Size C|10,001-100,000 miles across
|4|Size D|100,001-1,000,000 miles across
|5|Size E|1,000,001-10,000,000 miles across
|6|Size F|10,000,001 miles across or greater

Each planet in your galaxy may be a different shape. Roll below to determine the shape of the planet that is encountered. Remember, gravity on a spherical world is a central point at the center of world, and gravity on a Spelljamming ship is a straight line, bisecting the ship itself. Keep this in mind when the planet shape is determined.

##### Planet Shape

|**D10 Roll**|**Planet Shape**|
|:-:|:-:|
|1|Amorphous/Irregular|
|2|Cluster|
|3|Cubic
|4-6|Spherical|
|7|Flatworld|
|8|Elliptical|
|9|Triangular|
|10|Belt/Ring|

When a Spelljamming ship encounters a planet, the planet will also have a prevailing terrain type, largely determined by its overall planetary conditions. Roll twice on the table below to determine a generalized, overall planetary condition; Your first roll will be the "Main" condition type, and the second roll will be a "Sub" condition, to give you ideas on how to flavor the worlds that fill your skies. Remember that civilization will thrive in many conditions, and adventure should be able to happen anywhere to keep your players interested.

```
```

##### Planet Conditions

**D4**|**Conditions**
:-----:|:-----
1|Air ("Gas Giant" Planet; May not have land-able surface; "Surface" may consist of floating islands)
2|Earth (Jungle/Forest/Plains/Hills/Mountains)
3|Water (Water/Ice/Steam)
4|Fire (Desert/Mountains/Lava)

For example, a Water/Earth planet may generate the Earth we know in our solar system, and an Earth/Fire planet may generate the Mars we know in our solar system. In the case of rolling the same type of conditions for both the Main- and Sub-type, the condition that's rolled would be overwhelmingly abundant on the planet, such as a planet made entirely of water or jungle.


For each planet in your galaxy roll 1d12 on the table below:

##### Moons

**d12**|**Moon Type**
:-----:|:-----:
1-7|No moons
8|Planetary ring
9|1d4 barren moons
10|Habitable moon: roll on Planet Color table for technology level, and on Planet Conditions table for conditions
11|Colony/Mine
12|Roll 1d8+2 twice on this table

### 6. Population and Technology

When players enter a dungeon room, they are able to ascertain information from the various objects in the room. The same will show for the galaxy's you create. There are several planet types that can be encountered, and their color (shown on a map or display, or seen twinkling from a distance in a spyglass) may show a generalized society and technology level that will be encountered when visiting that star.

##### Planet Color

**D8**|**Planet Color**
:-----:|:-----
1|Red
2|Orange
3|Yellow
4|Green
5|Blue
6|Violet
7|Black
8|White

```
```

<br>

<div style='margin-top:460px'></div>

**Red**- Dead; littered with forgotten dungeons, relics, and ancient evil. Has no life, or almost no life.<br>
**Orange**- Dying; Post-societal barbarism. Civilization has collapsed, for the most part. Remnants of old, broken technology and magic.<br>
**Yellow**- Primeval; Large swaths of unexplored wilderness. Beginnings of civilization.<br>
**Green**- Early Civilization; Possibility of early firearms.<br>
**Blue**- Civilized; Generally advised to be approximately equal to the PC's technology level.<br>
**Violet**- Highly Advanced; Generally advised to contain technology more advanced or different than the current technology the PC's have seen.<br>
**Black**- This planet appears dark, almost silhouetted against the void of space. It hides it's true technology level. Roll 1d6 on Planet Color table to determine the stars actual technology level, keeping the Black color.<br>
**White**- Sentient planet with mystical powers.<br><br>

Now that you've created the universe, you've got to fill it with adventure and mystery for your players. There are several types of encounters that can take place in the depths of space and on the surface (or below the surface) of a planet.

### Random Encounters

While real life space is filled with empty void, fantasy wildspace is a place of exciting intrigue. Roll on the table below to use as idea seeds to fill your campaign with interesting events.

##### Random Encounter Table

| D20 | Random Encounter |
|:-:|:-:|
|1|Planetary/Wildspace Storm |
|2|Space Pirates |
|3|Space and/or Time Anomaly |
|4|Dead Ship, with no distress signal |
|5|NPC in space (clinging to floating debris) |
|6|Random Dragon Encounter |
|7|Large NPC convoy of ships, guarded |
|8|Ship encounter, same size as party's ship |
|9|1d4 vessels, in the midst of combat |
|10|Ancient space probe, similar to the *Voyager*|
|11|Crew-related Event: intruder, stowaway, sickness, etc |
|12|Ship encounter, smaller than party's ship |
|13|Trader encounter |
|14|Harmless School of random beast encounter |
|15|Ship encounter, larger than party's ship |
|16|Boarding Party |
|17|Undead Encounter |
|18|Cargo related event |
|19|Dead Ship, signalling distress |
|20|Space Leviathan |

### Everything Else

Thinking of the galaxy we've created here, we've come up with the overall feel of the inside of this Crystal Shell, the Primary Body, all celestial bodies that surround it, as well as a generalized look and feel of each of those bodies, and seeds to what those bodies contain. The rules listed here show how to survive and thrive in this new place. It is now up to the DM to determine what to fill each of these worlds with.

Entire campaigns have taken place on single planets, continents, and even in single cities. Spelljammer is no different; the worlds you create can be as many and varied as the number of stars in the sky. The only differences are that now, entire campaigns will be able to span millions of potential worlds and touch the lives of the various beings that exist there. The only limit is your imagination.<br><br>

See you space cowboy.

# Objectives for Gameplay Rules

## Ship Combat

### On size, weapons, AC, and Maneuverability
The primary goal is to make sure all ships have some utility in the universe, and most have a role to fill in larger engagements while maintaining balance between large heavy hitters and small nimble ships.

Small ships with few HP should have a high AC (mostly benefitted from their MC), and they should put large weapons at dis adv when firing at them. This should extend their survivability when confronted with larger, more heavily armed ships.

Large ships should have ok AC and crap maneuverability, teh MC should only be augmented to mediocre numbers when the helmsmen is willing and able to dump resources into the helm (hp, spell slots, ki, etc). They should have difficulties hitting small vessels with their large siege weapons, and eitehr need some smaller weapons, or their own wing of smaller ships.

Think BSG - naval engagements have large ships firing salvos at one another, while using smaller weapons to target the small fighters. Small ship will be the backbone of "bombing" runs, fighter engagements, or boarding attempts - targeting specific siege weapons and ship systems on the larger ships, eliminating defensive fighter wings, and closing the gap for boarding.

The systems I imagine to help with this are the changes to AC, MC, and Armor Plating computations.

AC = 10 + Maneuverability Class (MC) + Armor Plating Bonus (AP)

So a large ship will often have a low MC, but have a high AP. Using the above equation, 10 + 2 + 5 = 17

A small ship will often have much better MC, but a lower AP. think 10 + 5 + 3 = 18, and the helmsman has optino to temporarily increase the MC further.

While these numbers are close raw (by design), the ship with the higher MC will have many Maneuver options to increase speed, AC, or force dis adv at the expense of less Damage mitigation offered by better AP.


MC can be reduced in multiple ways, so smaller ships have more to lose from tactical attacks aginst them, whereas AP cannot be reduced in meaningful ways in combat, so larger ships AC, even with an MC of 1, will be much more durable.

Assuming MC has been reduced to the minimum of 1, using the above numbers a small ship will have an AC of 14 where a larger ship will have an AC of 16.

These are scratch numbers but should exemplify the kind of balance I am going for.

### On Ship Speed

Locomotion in wildspace is mostly based on the power of the helm + the resources spent by the helmsman. Ship speed = helm rating + MC. Smaller vessels should be naturally fast but only support weaker helms. Larger ships supporting better helms but with less MC should be a little bit slower unless the helmsman spends resources.

In some ways, most ships should have very similar AC, SR, and MC in specific situations - the idea to to make them smaller ship naturally more maneuverable and fast, albeit more fragile, while making the larger ship naturally more sturdy, less nimble, and slow, like one would expect in larger naval engagements.

I wanted the large ships to foocus on salvos and bombardment, while having smaller ships focus on tactical maneuvers and closing gaps.


### On Helmsman Resources and the Helms

I am still working through this and I need some feedback. Originally in 2e, ALL helmsman actions required spending resources, using spell slots. This was compounded by the prevelance of minor/major helms in most ships. My desire here is to reduce the heavy requirement on caster resources. I want to make lifejammer/ki helms more prevelent, as well as decreasing the rarity of fixed power helms like antiforges. I also want to reduce the antifoorge reliance on powerful magic weapons, and instead provide mechanisms like planer crystals to provide power. This is much easier if some of the Eberron lore and items are available in the spelljamming universe.

I ma currently torn on weather to require the helmsman to spend resources to perform maneuvers. The requirement would make maneuvers more rare, but would also leave a helmsman with less resources when combat moves from ship to hand to hand. I dont want partys relying on a single player for all helm tasks which gimp them in combat. I also dont want players to pretty much require a henchmen caster to fly their like often happened in 2e. Sure, crews should have hired help to take the helm when they go on away missions or boarding attempts, but I want players to mostly control the ship in combat.

Still though, takeoff, landing, wildspace traveling, and increasing the Helm rating should all require some of the helmsman resources, after all, the helmsman has the most control over the player ship and will alm ost always take Officer actions every ship combat turn, and always move/turn the ship every ship combat turn.

Soo this is currently a big wall I have hit, I would like other folks take on this.

### On Officer Actions and Roles

the thoughts behind thes roles and actions are to enable every party member to take part of ship copmbat rounds. While they players would normally just man siege weapons in 2e, for many characters this is not really in their personality or expertise to do so. Also, the npc crew exists, some of them gunners, some riggers, some hull techs, etc. They are mostly handling the core ship duties in a fight. What I think was missing in ship combat that has always been a focus in hand t hand d&d combat, is the feeling of being able to uniquely add to the party's capabilities in a set piece. Also, I wanted to create abilities for roles that have minimal overlap, but provide a number of different combinations to tip the advantage in the battle in compelling ways. Thus, Officer Actions.

## Questions for Playtesters
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div class='wide'>
### Ship Combat to Hand to Hand Round ratio
Currently, the ratio is 1/10, Should this be reduced?

### Ship Armor Damage Thresholds
Should this exist? Should certain sized ships just be immune from certain sized siege weapons? Should this be a DR instead? Should it be based on the Type Armour Plating?

### Officer Abilities by Level or Other Mechanism
Should office abilities be granted as the character levels, spends time sailing or spelljamming, or should all options be granted from the start? When should they come online? what character level?

### How many "debris" (death) saves should there be?
currently, it was envisioned to be the number of your armor plating rating, but I think it may be better to use a flat rate value like 3 or 5.

### On pronouns and gendered words......

helmsman, shantyman, etc. Help!
