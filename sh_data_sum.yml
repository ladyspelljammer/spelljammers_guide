    Summary: |
      The Angelship is a Kobold ship that is rarely seen in space. They once comprised the backbone of the Kobold space fleet but were nearly wiped out of existence by the elven armada.
      They were named for a Kobold legend of winged humans who healed fallen warriors.
    Crew: |
      Listed crew size is for humans. If the crew is composed of kobolds or other small creatures, the minimum crew size is increased to 12 and similarly the maximum crew is increased to 66.
    Interior Layout: |
      The helm and bridge of the Angelship lie in a large central chamber positioned where the wings meet the hull of the ship. Crew quarters are located forward of the bridge, just behind the front ram, and in warrens in the wings. The galley is located aft of the bridge, and the cargo holds are located aft of that.
    Ship Uses:
      Trading: |
        The Angelship is able to easily take off and land at land-based ports, making it idea as a trading vessel and at one time were the most popular merchant vessel in the void.
      Bulk Cargo Hauling: |
        Stripped down versions of the Angelship have seen service as bulk cargo transports. They are less sturdy than their standard counterparts, due to hollowing out of the interior, but these changes increase the cargo space by 26 tons, to a total of 47 tons.
      Naval Fleet: |
        The Angelship has long since fallen out of favor in modern space navies, primarily due to its small size. However, Kobolds have continued to use stealth versions of the Angelship, painted flat black and cloaked with darkness and invisibility spells. This particular type of Angelship is commonly known as the Dark Angel, and is used for sneak attacks.

    Summary: |
      The Argosy is a spelljamming ship built and used by gravs .
    Description: |
      The only vessel known to be used by the gravs, the Argosy resembles a small, unworked asteroid . This is intentional misdirection in order to discourage pirates and other potential threats. The ship's stone surface is pitted and scarred with craters, but some of these craters are actually concealed portholes and weapons pits. One portion of the Argosy is flattened, allowing it to land and take on passengers and precious cargo. Most of the interior of the ship is cargo space for mined ore and gems, with the cargo holds serving double duty as the crew and officers' quarters.
      The armaments of the Argosy are strictly for defensive purposes, and will remain hidden behind secret doors at the bottom of deep craters. The weapons will only be revealed and used if the gravs believe that a ship has detected their presence and is intent on boarding them. Argosies are powered by major helms of the most powerful variety.
    Crew: |
      An Argosy will be crewed by 90-120 worker gravs, led by 3-4 elite gravs, who serve as the ship's officers. One or more of the elite gravs will be a wizard of up to 9th level, and will serve as the ship's helmsman. Since the small gravs use half as much air as a human , the Argosy is quite capable of carrying a much larger crew of gravs. This is uncommon, however, since the elite gravs prefer to be able to voyage greater distances.
    Ship Uses:
      Mining: |
        Argosies are constantly looking for promising asteroids on which to set up mining operations. When an asteroid is encountered which is believed to have mineral wealth, the gravs will land and investigate. If the gravs determine that the mineral haul is small, but worth exploiting, then the crew of the Argosy will set up a temporary mining camp, and quickly mine the most accessible ore, loading it aboard the Argosy. If the asteroid's mineral wealth is greater, the crew of the Argosy will excavate a more long-term underground mining camp. This camp will be disguised so that it is difficult to discover. Once this underground camp is completed, a portion of the Argosy's crew (typically 30 worker gravs led by a single elite grav) will be left behind to begin mining operations, as the Argosy moves on. As well as searching for new mining sites, the Argosy travels to existing mining camps, bringing supplies and replacement workers to the camps, and hauling away ores and gems. Presumably the supplies and replacements are brought from the grav homeworld, while the ores are brought back to that world, however since the grav homeworld has never been located, this is impossible to verify.
    Other Configurations:
      None: |
        No other configurations have been encountered for the Argosy; however, the disguised nature of the craft means that many spacefarers are not even aware of the existence of the ship, let alone of any other configurations.

    Summary: |
      The Armada is a spelljamming ship built and used by elves .
    Description: |
      The largest of the elven ships (aside from the unconfirmed rumours of dreadnoughts made from starfly_plant mother-trees), the Armada is reserved exclusively for the use of the Imperial Elven Navy, and individual elven nations. Possession of an Armada by other races or factions is punishable by death at the hands of the Imperial Elven Navy, both for the user and the individuals who provided the craft. The elven Armada is built along a butterfly-like body created from the magically-modified fruit of the starfly plant, but the wings are straightened and strengthened such that the upper surfaces form a landing surface for Flitters . A typical Armada will carry a total of 40 Flitters, five of which have magical helms, and the rest of which are de-powered. This is possible because elves only use major helms of the most powerful sort (those capable of moving up to 140 tons) on their Armadas.
    Crew: |
      The Armada, moreso even than any other elven ship, has a rigid, military crew and a strong chain of command. Since an Armada is often the heart of naval operations, commanding a number of lesser vessels, it is likely to carry more high-ranking officers than a Man-o-War . An Armada typically carries a full crew of 200 elves, which is enough to man the ship, operate all of the weapons, and provide pilots and archers for the Flitters the Armada carries. This overloading of crew is possible because an Armada carries extensive gardens that both freshen the air envelope, and provide fresh fruits and vegetables on long voyages. In addition, Armadas always carry large numbers of mages and priests who are able to magically refresh the air envelope through various spells.
    Ship Uses:
      Military: |
        The chief use of the Armada is as a base for large military actions against other factions, races, or planets . Their heavy firepower and their use of large numbers of Flitters makes them a dangerous weapon. The Flitters carried by an Armada are used as messengers, landing craft, and fighters, carrying archers and mages to target enemy weapon emplacements and crew. The heart of an Armada's operation is in the forward bridge, located in the "head" of the butterfly. This is the location of the helm and the captain's station. An auxiliary bridge is located in the tail of the craft, just foreward of the jettisons . This auxiliary bridge is equipped with a full set of charts and a second major helm (this second helm is often not as powerful as the primary, and an Armada forced to use it may need to abandon some or all of its Flitters). The Armada is the backbone of the elven fleet and often serves as the heart of military operations. A standard fleet may contain a single Armada, or 10 or more acting in unison, supported by a fleet of Men-o-War and hundreds of Flitters.
    Other Configurations:
      Command Post: |
        The flagship of a particular elven fleet will be an armada that has been modified to serve as a command post. These ships have command fortresses built on their backs, which house the fleet admiral and his command staff. These citadels are used both as military centres and as quarters for entertaining important allies, or for negotiating with surrendering fleets. These command posts add 20 tons to the size of the Armada (increasing hull points accordingly, and adding 10 tons of cargo space, but otherwise leaving the vessel's statistics unchanged), which reduces the number of Flitters that the ship can carry.
      Wild Armadas: |
        Armadas are normally not abandoned, given the length of time it takes to grow one, and their long lifespans. The elven nations would rather destroy this type of ship than let it fall into another race's hands. Should an abandoned, overgrown Armada be found despite this, its AR would be 9 and its MC would be E. This can be corrected with proper pruning and repairs equal to half the hull points of the ship.
      Gypsy Moth: |
        Drow operating in space are rare, and in recent decades have begun to operate their own custom-made spacecraft; however, long before their presence in space was confirmed, there were rumours of one or more so-called Gypsy Moth Armadas. The Gypsy Moth is a purplish Armada with a huge dome where the command post would be, in order to filter out light that would be painful for the drow, giving the ship the appearance of a bloated hunchback. These rumours have recently been confirmed, although it is unknown if the Gypsy Moth is unique. It is unknown how the drow obtained the Gypsy Moth (or possibly Gypsy Moths) from the Imperial Elven Navy; however, it seems unlikely that any new Armadas modified in this fashion will appear in space, since the drow now have their own Jade_Spider Commandships that suit their needs better. The Imperial Elven Navy has organized several expeditions to hunt down and destroy the Gypsy Moth, but the wily drow crew has so far evaded their more numerous cousins.

    Summary: |
      The Barge of Ptah was built by early space-faring humans to defend against attacks by the orcs , ogres , kobolds and goblins . They were slow and clumsy, and often became deathtraps for their crews. Many are to be found abandoned in the spacelanes, but some few still perform their original function.
    Crew: |
      While the minimum number of crew may seem high for a ship of the Barge of Ptah's size, this many were necessary due to the difficulty of handling, maze of the interior and the sheer array of weaponry onboard.
    Interior Layout: |
      The Barge of Ptah resembles sea-going ships. The foredeck is home to two catapults and two ballistas, along with the ram. Amidships is an open deck, and the hatches leading to the cargo holds below. The aftcastle is home to the crew quarters, temple, captains quarters, spelljammers quarters, and above all of these on the aftcastle is the dome of stars, which is home to the ship's helm, and the rest of the catapults and ballistas.
    Ship Uses:
      Templeship: |
        As a result of the these ships being crewed by the clergy of Ptah , they double as temples in space. They were, as a result, often rich in treasure, as offerings to Ptah were often made here, making them lucrative targets.
      Battle Barge: |
        Called "Battle Barges" these are captured Barges of Ptah, now in use by the navies of the Orcs and Ogres and their allied worlds. Rather than a major helm, these ships most often use a Death helm, and hold slaves onboard for propulsion.
      Cargo Raft: |
        Salvaged Barges of Ptah occassionally see service as stripped-down bulk cargo vessels. Service aboard these spartan and unprotected vessels is unpopular and is occassionally used as punishment for minor crimes.

    Summary: |
      The Batship is a unique spelljamming ship built by an unknown race.
    description: |
      The Batship is a unique vessel that is the terror of any crystal_sphere in which it is found. The ship resembles a gargantuan bat with crystalline teeth and claws, and metallic skin. In fact, the Batship looks and moves so much like a living creature, that many who have encountered it (and lived to tell the tale) believe that it is in fact alive. Many also believe that the ship is sentient. The Batship has two exposed decks, one along the vessel's back, and one along the belly. The helm is located deep within the ship's "chest" but there is no known way to get to it; no corridors or doorways leading to it. The ship actually has two distinct configurations. In normal flight mode it appears almost like any other ship; flat and non-descript with two exposed decks. In battle mode, however, the ship curls and attacks feet first, with the decks curving to follow the body. Inexplicably, the ship's gravity plane curves with the ship, so the Batship is not plagued by changes in gravity.
      The box helm keeps the Batship's helmsman trapped levitating inside, unaging, unhungering, and unable to be harmed. Each move made by the helmsman is mimicked by the Batship, and as a result the vessel's maneuverability is linked to the dexterity of the helmsman. The current helmsman has Dex 19, giving the ship MC A. The SR of the ship is not based on the abilities of the helmsman, but attacks with the vessel's "natural" weapons are based upon the helmsman's THAC0.
      When in battle, the Batship's natural weaponry is far superior to the meager conventional weaponry that the ship carries. The Batship has a quasi-magical breath weapon which allows it to spit a globular mass of semi-liquid substance which eats through an enemy ship's hull at a rate of 1 HP per round (make a save vs. acid at -5 every round after the first to see if the damage is halted). If this substance is exposed to open flame, it immediately explodes in a 17-die fireball . This breath weapon can be used up to 3 times, with 4 hours of non-use being required to recharge a single use. The ship can also bite another vessel for 1d4 HP of damage (4d10 hp against a creature), with a natural 20 on the attack roll resulting in spelljammer shock for the opposing helmsman. Each claw can attack for 1d2 HP or 2d10 hp of damage, while the tail can be used to grapple an enemy ship. The tail is also used to tow captured ships.
      The cloth wings of the Batship are magical, similar to a Cloak of Reflection . These wings protect the ship and crew from the following effects:
        Magic Missile : reflected back at caster at full strength with no save
        Shocking Grasp : nullified
        Irritation : reflected back, saving throw applies
        Ray of Enfeeblement : reflected back, saving throw applies
        Hold spells of all sorts: distorted and reflected back as Slow spells, saving throw applies
        Polymorph spells of all sorts: reflected back at caster who must save vs. spell at +2; if save fails intended form is received and system shock must be rolled
        Feeblemind : reflected back, saving throw vs. spells at +2 applies
        Entangle : nullified
        Any helm altering or damaging spell: reflected back at caster's ship at normal effect with no save
      All that is known of the history of the Batship is that it was created by a mage (possibly human ) centuries ago in a sphere far away, where the_phlogiston is very thin, and rivers in the flow rare and slow. This makes the sphere very difficult to reach. The woman at the ship's helm, Burnayette_Skyansdanya , has been the helmsman since the ship's creation, and is from the same far-away sphere as the mysterious creator. She has been driven mad by her time in the box helm, but at her most lucid she claims that she is only waiting for "him" to show up to remove her curse. In recent decades the Batship has lurked in Realmspace , although it is known to have raided the spacelanes of Krynnspace in the past.
    Crew: |
      The Batship can be operated by a crew consisting solely of the helmsman; however, it typically carries 12 other crew as well. These crew are needed solely to perform repairs and maintenance. In battle they man the ballistas , and serve as boarding troops to mop up any resistance that remains after the Batship's devastating attack. The crew is currently made up of human pirates, but in the past it has included many other races. If the helmsman of the Batship determines that more crew are needed (either to replace crew who have died, or simply to increase the number of crew carried) then anyone boarding the ship must save vs. spell with each step or become Charmed into becoming one of the crew. This effect can be nullified if the person is removed from the ship, and a Remove Curse is cast.
    Ship Uses:
      Raider: |
        The Batship is a menace to shipping, since it raids ceaselessly. Countless ships have been lost or plundered at the claws of the Batship. It is unknown why the helmsman endlessly engages in these raids, but it is likely a byproduct of her insanity.
    Other Configurations: |
      Since the Batship is unique, there are no other configurations.

    Summary: |
      The Battlewagon is a spelljamming ship built and used by scro .
    Description: |
      The massive scro Battlewagon symbolizes the scro's emerging power within the spelljamming arena. Unlike the Mantis , the Battlewagon is not designed for boarding actions, and instead carries a large number of ranged weapons. This is not because the crew of a Battlewagon are any less devoted to personal combat than any other scro, but rather because a Battlewagon will carry an admiral, and is therefore expected to always be in a position from which the admiral can properly command his fleet.
      The deadly efficiency of the Battlewagon makes it a ship that few other vessels can stand up to in a fight. Indeed, the shear number of catapults and ballistas carried means that few enemy ships survive long enough for the Battlewagon to get within range to use its greek_fire_projector . In addition to this impressive array of weaponry, a Battlewagon typically carries 20-40 goblin Blades . Some of these Blades will be used as messengers to carry important messages and charts to and from the other ships in the scro fleet, while the rest will be used as boarding boats in combat, allowing the crew of the Battlewagon to enjoy hand-to-hand combat, even while the ship itself remains unconstrained by grapples.
    Crew: |
      A Battlewagon typically carries a full crew of 160 scro, twice what its air envelope can safely support. As on other scro ships, this overcrowding is not considered to be a concern, since the war priests regularly cast Fog Cloud spells to refresh the air envelope. A Battlewagon will invariably be under the command of an 8 HD almighty leader, who will be the admiral of the fleet that the ship leads. The admiral's staff will include another almighty leader serving as the captain for the Battlewagon, and next in line to command the fleet should the admiral fall. The rest of the admiral's staff staff will usually consist of 8 6 HD captains, who serve as both advisors and bodyguards. In some cases, the advisors will be of other races that the almighty leader finds useful, such as ogre_magi , humans , or other, more exotic creatures. The other officers on board consist of 10 6 HD captains, who fulfill various roles, and 10 war priests, each of whom is a 5th level cleric/mage. The war priests serve as helmsmen, navigators, combat support, and spiritual leaders. In these roles, the war priests provide a great deal of advice to the almighty leader. The non-commissioned officers directly in command of individual teams of crew consist of 26 4 HD sergeants, who lead 104 standard 3 HD marines.
    Ship Uses:
      Command Ship: |
        While the scro will use any suitably powerful vessel as a command ship (ogre mammoths are popular, as are smilodons ), the Battlewagon is the ship that they designed specifically for this purpose, and all six Battlewagons known to exist (the Decapitator , Conflagrator , Devastator , Eviscerator , Mutilator , and Defenestrator ) serve as flagships of important and powerful fleets. In this role, the Battlewagon will typically be encountered with 2-8 other combat ships, such as Mantises (this is in addition to the Blades carried). In combat, the Battlewagon will usually stay just within range of its medium weapons, while directing its accompanying vessels to close for boarding.
    Other Configurations:
      While the admiral of a scro fleet has absolute authority over all ships in that fleet, and would be able to order any modification he desired for his flagship, in practice the Battlewagon sees no modifications. The only customization that an almighty leader will typically allow for his ultimate warship would be markings on the hull signifying the ships that the Battlewagon has destroyed or captured.

    Summary: |
      The Blade is a spelljamming ship built by goblins and used by goblinkin and humans . It is adapted from the Arrow , a ship built by kobolds .
    Description: |
      The Blade is a small, short-range attack ship. Developed from the earlier, unarmoured Kobold Arrow, the Blade was primarily used in kamikaze ram attacks on enemy vessels in space-battles. Ogre Mammoths usually carried several of these ships as boarding boats, Goblin Porcupine_Ships would often carry one or two for use as scouts, while Orc Scorpions often carried a few Blades to herd targets towards the claws of the parent ship. The kamikaze use of Blades began in earnest when the goblinkin began to be pressed by the elven fleets in the First_Unhuman_War .
      A Blade is shaped much like an arrowhead, with the helm (or controls for the non-magical engine) amidships and the weapons platform topside. While the Blade was once used almost exclusively by goblinkin, they are now commonly used by many races in space. Goblinkin still favour the craft, while humans and halflings find it ideal for short-range uses. Giff and gnomes often use Blades as test platforms for experimental weapons and devices.
    Crew: |
      A single pilot is required to handle the Blade. Since the craft is intended for short-range use only, it is not uncommon for a Blade to carry more crew than its air envelope can safely support. A typical crew for humans or orcs would consist of a single pilot and a single weaponeer (the greek_fire_projector is generally a one-shot device, so reloading it is not considered a priority). Goblins and kobolds tend to have crews of 4-8 (except when being used as a kamikaze craft, in which case a single pilot is used, often in a fanatical crazed state induced by potions brewed by the tribal shaman), while ogre-operated Blades tend to carry as many ogres as can hang on to the outside, along with the pilot (a maximum of 8 ogres can be carried, but it is not uncommon for several of these ogres to lose their grip and fall away from the Blade as it maneuvers towards the enemy).
    Ship Uses:
    Boarding Boat: |
      When used as a boarding boat, the Blade is usually stripped of any weaponry, although it is not uncommon for a light ballista to be fitted, firing a harpoon-like projectile with a line attached to aid in grappling with an enemy ship (range of this light ballista is reduced to 1 hex because of the line). The rails of the upper platform are usually lined with shields, boarding pikes, and armoured bins of oil pots ready to throw. The preferred method of boarding is to come alongside an enemy ship as would be done in any other boarding action, but the small Blade can also set down directly on the deck of the target. Since the Blade is top-heavy and lacks landing gear, a Blade which sets down in this manner is 50% likely to tip over at a 45° angle, causing anyone on board to save vs. paralyzation or fall to the side for 1d6 points of damage. Boarding boats usually use non-magical helms (although Rudders of Propulsion are ideal in the extremely rare cases when they are available), and are typically released from their mothership only when it has already drawn close to the enemy.
    Ram: |
      When used as a mobile ram, the Blade is virtually always equipped with a non-magical engine, and no weaponry. This is because a Blade used for this purpose is destroyed by the impact, unless it is ramming another very small craft. These Blades are typically packed with greek fire, oil, smokepowder, and other explosives and flammables. The crew will usually attempt to bail out just before impact, but survival is not likely. If the target is hit normal damage is done, plus 1d4 hull points of damage from the explosion, which creates a fire as normal.
    Fighter: |
      The original intended purpose of the Blade was to serve as a fighter, and many are still used in this capacity. A fighter Blade is typically armed and equipped as above, usually with a boat helm rather than a non-magical engine. These craft typically fire one shot from the greek fire projector (most fighter Blades mount single-use greek fire projectors, since the small craft cannot easily handle a full-sized projector), and then either retreat to re-arm, or use on-board archers to harass the enemy, depending on the inclination of the crew. In this use, Blades by themselves are little threat to most ships, but can be deadly when supporting a larger craft. Fighter Blades are particularly well-suited for dealing with other small craft, such as flitters , since the Blade's ram is highly effective against other small craft.
    Scout: |
      Many goblin and orc tribes used Blades as scout vessels, and it is not uncommon for many different groups to use them in this function today. Scout Blades are usually equipped with boat helms, although minor helms are not uncommon. Blades operated by goblins or orcs in this function are typically piloted by an apprentice shaman, who is assisted by 1-3 bodyguards. Blades used as scouts are intended to run away from a fight, and so they typically mount a light catapult which they can use at long ranges to discourage pursuit, and which can be filled with jettison-shot as needed.
    Tug: |
      Blades can sometimes be found fitted with minor or major helms, and used as tugs. These ships usually operate close to asteroid bases in dangerous areas, where they can rescue disabled craft, bring in wrecks for salvage, or simply guide incoming vessels through dangerous approaches. In some cases tugs will be used to tow a number of cargo barges through safe areas of space, however these tugs have the distinct disadvantage of being unable to safely land.
    Escape Craft: |
      While this is a use to which Blades are often put, it is rare for this to be the intended use of the craft. Usually a Blade carried by another ship will be intended as a boarding boat, a fighter, or a scout, but unless equipped with a non-spelljamming power source, these ships are often useful escape craft if trouble befalls the parent ship. In some cases, however, Blades may be carried for the express purpose of serving as escape ships. These ships are typically equipped with furnace helms or boiler helms along with a supply of appropriate fuel. This is because in an emergency it is highly possible that no spell-casters will be available to pilot a more standard type of helm.
    Other Configurations:
      Kobold Arrow: |
        Not technically another configuration of the Blade, the Arrow is actually the original kobold design which the goblins adapted into the Blade. The Arrow (statistics are the same as the Blade except where given in parentheses above) uses the same basic configuration as the Blade, but lacks a weapons platform on the topside. Instead, the Arrow was designed with a built-in bottom-mounted greek fire projector. The wooden hull of the Arrow is unarmoured, and the craft is usually fitted with wooden runners to allow it to land on flat land. Arrows are now much less common than Blades, since they are no longer built in any large quantities. Overall the Blade is a superior craft, and the only real reason to build an Arrow rather than a Blade is that the Arrow is cheaper and easier to build. If this is the only consideration, however, most would prefer to build the even cheaper Kobold Dart , which was another later design based on the Arrow. Those Arrows which are used today tend to see use in the same roles as Blades.
      Rigging Cutter: |
        This variant is often used by goblinkin fighting under the banner of the scro . The first of these ships were modified Arrows, but the design has since been used on Blades as well. Rigging cutters are equipped and armed as normal fighters, and serve in the same role. The difference is that the side fins have been replaced with large steel blades. These blade-fins still serve the original function of aiding maneuverability, but also serve as rigging-shears, although without the possibility of working loose.

    Summary: |
      The Bloatfly is usually found only in close orbit around warm suns . They are used by the Lizardmen primarily as egg incubators, in the hopes that lizardmen hatched will be smarter and stronger.
    Crew: |
      Only six crew members are strictly required to operate the Bloatfly, but they generally contain at least a dozen guards to operate both the weapons and the incubation systems onboard.
      Commonly found amongst the crew of the Bloatfly is at least one shaman who acts as the medic and spiritual leader of the crew and a war leader. They are usually powered by hired human mages, and use a minor helm, but some are powered by furnaces.
    Interior Layout: |
      The Bloatfly has three levels, the upper decks, the main deck and the lower deck.
      The upper decks contain the small cargo hold of the Bloatfly, the bridge and the helm. The main deck is home to the armory, crew quarters, mess, another small cargo hold, and swim tubes that lead to the submerged lower deck.
      The lower deck contains the water-filled incubation tank, and the nutrient storage and delivery systems required to supply it.
    Ship Uses:
      Broodship: |
        Bloatflies have only ever been reported as being used as incubation ships for young lizardmen. No other uses are currently known.

    Summary: |
      The Caravel is a spelljamming ship built and used by groundling humans .
    Description: |
      Not designed for use in space, the Caravel is one of the most common craft used by groundlings who first discover space travel and acquire a spelljamming_helm . While more suitable for space travel than some other groundling ships, the Caravel suffers from the same drawbacks as most groundling ships taken into space. The Caravel has poor maneuverability and armour, little capacity to carry more crew than the minimum required to operate it, and insufficient weaponry to make up for these drawbacks in combat. Most spacefarers using a Caravel will upgrade to a more suitable spelljammer as soon as they can; assuming that they survive long enough.
    Crew: |
      When used as a spelljamming vessel, the number of crew required to operate the Caravel is somewhat lower than the crew required to operate it as a sailing ship, however it is still high relative to the ship's size. Whereas a seafaring Caravel will usually have a crew of about 20 men, and may even have a crew as large as 40 with as many as 20 passengers, a Caravel which carries this number of men into space will quickly foul its air envelope. Most spelljamming Caravels carry a full crew of 10 men, although for shorter voyages double this number is frequently carried. The intent is that the extra crew will be able to help fend off any attackers.
    Ship Uses:
      Trader: |
        Most Caravels in space are used as trading vessels. The only advantage that such a ship has over more capable ships designed for spelljamming is the fact that a Caravel can land in the water, and trade with groundling ports without attracting undue attention. In some of the safest areas of space using a Caravel as a trading vessel is actually a viable option; however, most of wildspace is not safe for the Caravel.
    Other Configurations:
      None: Modifications to the Caravel are rare, since it is usually more cost-effective to simply purchase a better ship.

    Summary: |
      The Cargo Barge is a spelljamming ship built by humans and used by most spacefaring races.
    Description: |
      The simple cargo barge is an ancient design which has remained unchanged since the first days of human spacefaring. These unglamorous, usually battered craft are simple boats dominated by massive hitching-bollards for towing, and in some cases by high, removable side walls used to make carried cargo more secure. The cargo barge is not really intended to operate as a ship in its own right, but is rather intended to be towed by another ship. A towed cargo barge reduces the maneuverability of the towing ship to F.
    Crew: |
      None, although common practice is to assign one crewman of the towing ship to each barge in tow, allowing the crew to keep a watch on the lashings and security of the cargo. On those rare occasions when a cargo barge is under its own power it will typically carry a single pilot, or a pilot and a backup.
    Ship Uses:
      Towed Cargo Hauler: |
        Barges are almost always used in space voyaging to bring extra air and cargo. Barges are popular amongst traders, explorers on long-range voyages, and warships wishing to carry extra crew. In a combat situation, the towed barge will typically be cut loose to restore the parent ship's maneuverability. The barge can even be cut loose in order to be used as an obstacle or a ram to bring about a "crash" result on an enemy.
      Slave Boat: |
        Some slavers have been known to use cargo barges to transport large quantities of slaves. One advantage of the cargo barge is that the ship's single open deck makes it very easy for a small number of slavers (typically 1 slaver for every 30-50 slaves) to keep an eye on all of the slaves. The major advantage of a cargo barge as a slave boat, however, is that even if there is a successful escape attempt on a slave boat, the towing craft can simply cut the barge loose, stranding the slaves in space without a helm, where they will quickly die. As a result, the slaves aboard a cargo barge tend not to make any escape attempts. If magical means to refresh the air envelope are available, these ships will often carry as many as 350 slaves in horrifically crowded conditions. The slaves are typically kept chained to long wooden beams that are bolted to the deck. When the time comes to unload the slaves, the beam will be unbolted, and all of the slaves chained to it (typically 20-40) will disembark simultaneously. The small crew hut will serve as the quarters for the slavers. Cargo barges serving as slave boats will typically be towed by a powerful combat ship. Illithids frequently use cargo barges as slave boats, typically with two illithid overseers. Illithid slave boats are usually equipped with series helms since even if a slave revolt is successful, the slaves will still be unable to pilot the ship.
      Shuttle Tugs: |
        A few cargo barges are equipped with helms of their own, and serve as escape craft and shuttles for the towing ship, or serve as a tug, towing several other cargo barges.
      Power Rams: |
        Neogi often use cargo barges for this purpose, although some other races are known to as well. A power ram is simply a cargo barge which is loaded with flammable or explosive materials (often a combination of greek fire, oil, smokepowder, and pitch) and allowed to crash into a ship or base. Power rams are piloted, since a cargo barge which is simply cut loose from a piloted ship will rarely hit its target. The neogi tend to use a standard lifejammer helm powered by a charmed slave on a power ram, an alarming concept since it shows that the neogi literally can afford to throwaway helms in this fashion. Other races using power rams tend to use temporary helms created by a Create Minor Helm spell. The pilot of such a craft is typically expected to escape in a wreckboat, or via magic, although sometimes the pilot will simply be a fanatic who is unconcerned with his own death.
    Other Configurations: None

    Summary: |
      The Citadel is a spelljamming ship built and used by dwarves .
    Description: |
      Dwarven Citadels are massive affairs, and the largest Citadel (such as that detailed here) that a forge can power is 700 tons in size. They can carry up to 700 dwarves comfortably, and many more if need be (since dwarves are size S, a 700 ton citadel could house 1,400 without straining the air envelope). They are festooned with heavy weapons, usually catapults , although other weapons are possible. The vessels are solidly built, a dwarven Citadel is not destroyed in battle, save by powerful magic or literally days of pounding. The Citadel might be taken, however, after a prolonged and bloody boarding action, or if the Citadel's air envelope can be somehow corrupted.
      Architecturally Citadels greatly resemble dwarven strongholds built in mountains or hills on groundling worlds. The surface features include a strongly guarded gate, on Citadels this is usually next to a dock or landing strip for visitors. Other smaller, gates will dot the Citadel's surface, some obvious and equally well guarded, others hidden from view, and nigh impossible to detect from outside the Citadel itself. Other surface features include towers and barbicans for the ship's defensive armaments. These surface features will often be along only one side of a Citadel, the "topside". The bottom is usually devoid of such features, to make working among larger asteroids much easier.
      On the inside, Citadels follow typical dwarven planning, with a plethora of traps and hidden passages. Guard animals and automatons are often available. Some Citadels favor smokepowder weapons, others prefer the more traditional torsion and counterweight siege weapons. In fact, Dungeon Masters with little time could easily convert a dwarven cavern complex from almost any TSR product into the deck plan for a dwarven citadel. The only major requirement, of course, are the facilities for the spelljamming forge, which resemble a normal dwarven forge.
      Citadels are named in the same way dwarven strongholds are named (and thus often do not have names that sound proper for ships in Common), and typically have a dwarven name, which is translated into common for non-dwarves. This translation is usually not strictly accurate, but rather a nickname. For example, the Citadel "Maralajak" is usually called the "Golden Forge" in Common, though the correct translation is "Hold of the Golden Forge".
    Crew: |
      Most dwarven Citadels are the home of one clan specializing in one or two crafts. The breakdowns given in the Monstrous Manual provide a quick and dirty method of deciding how many citadel inhabitants are male, how many female, how many children, and providing a quick breakdown of their weapons and abilities. Every Citadel, however, must have 3d6 forge-priests to operate the Spelljamming Forge. On some Citadels these replace the other priests often found within dwarven clans, but most clans have other priesthoods as well. Most Citadels, like most dwarven clans, offer respect and reverence to the entire dwarven pantheon but specially revere a single patron deity. Moradin, Dugmaren Brightmantle, Vergedain, and Dumathoin are the most popular patron dwarven deities for Citadels, though among War Citadels Clanggeddin is usually the patron.
      Only the largest Citadels (those 500 tons or larger in size) will carry more then one clan, unless a clan has been recently decimated by war, disease, or other misfortune and had to abandon its Citadel. These large Citadels will usually be led by a king, often called "King Within the Mountain", and are often the center of a dwarven nation. In wildspace , a dwarven nation will usually comprise 2-5 Citadels, with each Citadel holding 300-700 dwarves and being of the appropriate size. The single asteroid holding one clan is far more commonly encountered, though they might be part of a loose dwarven nation whose Citadels meet once every few years for council and feast days.
      Most dwarven Citadels are very rich; the dwarves within will have access to the some of the finest weapons and armor available. It would not be unusual for the entire bodyguard of the dwarven king, for example, to have weapons and armor of exceptional (+1) quality. Dwarven magics, such as hammer chants or dwarven forged magical weapons, will also be much in evidence. Most Citadels carry smaller vessels for use as shuttles, scouts, and landing craft. These are often chosen according to local conditions. The Whitebeard clan of the Tears of Selune in Realmspace , for example, uses heavily modified galleons because they are often sent to the planet Toril to trade with locals, or transport ore from remote mining camps. The galleons appear to be standard Torillian vessels, and the fact that they can fly is hidden. In this way the Whitebeards make it less likely every disreputable adventurer or minor lord around will attack their landing vessels looking for an easily obtained flying ship.
    Ship Uses: |
      Living Ship: |
        More than any other type of ship, the dwarven Citadel is a permanent home for its people. These ships engage in long-term missions (trading, discovery) according to the wishes of the majority of the population. Dissenters (if of sufficient number) may secede to form a new colony. In general, such living ships prefer not to engage in battle if possible, since they are not only the vessels, but also the permanent homes of the dwarves within. Citadels will fight to the best of their considerable ability if needed, however, often using their large size to force opponents to crash into them. This maneuver will almost invariably leave the larger Citadel the victor. As a byproduct of their source of power, as well as their lifestyle, the inhabitants of a living Citadel will usually have a large number of finished goods available for trade. Since anything made from metal or stone can be easily built by the dwarves, the best goods to trade with them are those that they have difficulty producing in sufficient amounts, such as food and textiles.
      Jihad Ship: |
        Dwarves in space are linked by blood and faith, such that any attack on a dwarven ship may be taken as an attack on the entire dwarven race. Every so often a council of kings and priests of the combined dwarven pantheons will gather together and declare a crusade against a people, sphere, or race. An enemy is declared anathema, and their ships and people are attacked on sight. Currently the neogi are the object of a dwarven jihad, although many other races also attack the neogi on sight. When a jihad is declared, several Citadels usually choose to actively follow the crusade rather than simply fighting the enemy if encountered. Such a jihad ship will have a large contingent of forge-tenders (maximum SR for the ship's size), double the normal numbers of heavy weapons, and also a large number of heavily armed and well-trained soldiers under the command of a fighter of at least 6th level (8th-10th level is more common). Jihad ships actively seek out enemy vessels and outposts, strafe them, board them, and slaughter those aboard to a man.
    Other Configurations:
      Abandoned Citadels: |
        The forges that power dwarven Citadels require a large amount of raw material to work properly. After a number of years (usually about 10-20 years per 100 tons of the ship), the Citadel's resources are exhausted and the people must find a new home. Once an asteroid of appropriate size is located, the forges are packed up and moved to their new home. Only then does construction begin on the new base. After one month per 100 tons of asteroid, the new Citadel has enough space to support the new population. At this point the old Citadel is abandoned. Abandoned Citadels are frequently used as bases and lairs by other spaceborne races and creatures. Former Citadels may be the home of pirates, monsters, smugglers, or any number of other creatures. Given the size of the largest Citadels, multiple monsters and groups can hold portions of a single Citadel, sometimes working together, and sometimes in conflict. Since Citadels are not always completely stripped before being abandoned, they usually attract adventurers like a magnet. If the Citadel's population is sufficiently large at the time of abandonment, more than one asteroid may be selected, with the ships forges and population being split between the two craft, allowing each side to pursue its own course. Similarly, dying kingdoms, torn by war or disease, may be swept up by groups in larger Citadels, leaving abandoned ships that are not fully exploited.

        Gnomish Citadels are to dwarven Citadels what gnomish Sidewheelers are to normal ships - a bad satire. Abandoned dwarven Citadels are often taken over by gnomes , who simulate the effects of the forges with their various gizmos. In reality their devices add nothing to the final output of the system, causing the ship to drift as aimlessly as when it was abandoned. Gnomes usually come up with careful explanations that detail why they wanted to go in the direction they are drifting anyway. Gnomish Citadels are generally avoided, since more than one has been seen to explode dramatically following failed experiments.

    Summary: |
      The Citadel is a spelljamming ship built and used by dwarves .
    Description: |
      Dwarven Citadels are massive affairs, and the largest Citadel (such as that detailed here) that a forge can power is 700 tons in size. They can carry up to 700 dwarves comfortably, and many more if need be (since dwarves are size S, a 700 ton citadel could house 1,400 without straining the air envelope). They are festooned with heavy weapons, usually catapults , although other weapons are possible. The vessels are solidly built, a dwarven Citadel is not destroyed in battle, save by powerful magic or literally days of pounding. The Citadel might be taken, however, after a prolonged and bloody boarding action, or if the Citadel's air envelope can be somehow corrupted.
      Architecturally Citadels greatly resemble dwarven strongholds built in mountains or hills on groundling worlds. The surface features include a strongly guarded gate, on Citadels this is usually next to a dock or landing strip for visitors. Other smaller, gates will dot the Citadel's surface, some obvious and equally well guarded, others hidden from view, and nigh impossible to detect from outside the Citadel itself. Other surface features include towers and barbicans for the ship's defensive armaments. These surface features will often be along only one side of a Citadel, the "topside". The bottom is usually devoid of such features, to make working among larger asteroids much easier.
      On the inside, Citadels follow typical dwarven planning, with a plethora of traps and hidden passages. Guard animals and automatons are often available. Some Citadels favor smokepowder weapons, others prefer the more traditional torsion and counterweight siege weapons. In fact, Dungeon Masters with little time could easily convert a dwarven cavern complex from almost any TSR product into the deck plan for a dwarven citadel. The only major requirement, of course, are the facilities for the spelljamming forge, which resemble a normal dwarven forge.
      Citadels are named in the same way dwarven strongholds are named (and thus often do not have names that sound proper for ships in Common), and typically have a dwarven name, which is translated into common for non-dwarves. This translation is usually not strictly accurate, but rather a nickname. For example, the Citadel "Maralajak" is usually called the "Golden Forge" in Common, though the correct translation is "Hold of the Golden Forge".
    Crew: |
      Most dwarven Citadels are the home of one clan specializing in one or two crafts. The breakdowns given in the Monstrous Manual provide a quick and dirty method of deciding how many citadel inhabitants are male, how many female, how many children, and providing a quick breakdown of their weapons and abilities. Every Citadel, however, must have 3d6 forge-priests to operate the Spelljamming Forge. On some Citadels these replace the other priests often found within dwarven clans, but most clans have other priesthoods as well. Most Citadels, like most dwarven clans, offer respect and reverence to the entire dwarven pantheon but specially revere a single patron deity. Moradin, Dugmaren Brightmantle, Vergedain, and Dumathoin are the most popular patron dwarven deities for Citadels, though among War Citadels Clanggeddin is usually the patron.
      Only the largest Citadels (those 500 tons or larger in size) will carry more then one clan, unless a clan has been recently decimated by war, disease, or other misfortune and had to abandon its Citadel. These large Citadels will usually be led by a king, often called "King Within the Mountain", and are often the center of a dwarven nation. In wildspace , a dwarven nation will usually comprise 2-5 Citadels, with each Citadel holding 300-700 dwarves and being of the appropriate size. The single asteroid holding one clan is far more commonly encountered, though they might be part of a loose dwarven nation whose Citadels meet once every few years for council and feast days.
      Most dwarven Citadels are very rich; the dwarves within will have access to the some of the finest weapons and armor available. It would not be unusual for the entire bodyguard of the dwarven king, for example, to have weapons and armor of exceptional (+1) quality. Dwarven magics, such as hammer chants or dwarven forged magical weapons, will also be much in evidence. Most Citadels carry smaller vessels for use as shuttles, scouts, and landing craft. These are often chosen according to local conditions. The Whitebeard clan of the Tears of Selune in Realmspace , for example, uses heavily modified galleons because they are often sent to the planet Toril to trade with locals, or transport ore from remote mining camps. The galleons appear to be standard Torillian vessels, and the fact that they can fly is hidden. In this way the Whitebeards make it less likely every disreputable adventurer or minor lord around will attack their landing vessels looking for an easily obtained flying ship.
    Ship Uses: |
      Living Ship: |
        More than any other type of ship, the dwarven Citadel is a permanent home for its people. These ships engage in long-term missions (trading, discovery) according to the wishes of the majority of the population. Dissenters (if of sufficient number) may secede to form a new colony. In general, such living ships prefer not to engage in battle if possible, since they are not only the vessels, but also the permanent homes of the dwarves within. Citadels will fight to the best of their considerable ability if needed, however, often using their large size to force opponents to crash into them. This maneuver will almost invariably leave the larger Citadel the victor. As a byproduct of their source of power, as well as their lifestyle, the inhabitants of a living Citadel will usually have a large number of finished goods available for trade. Since anything made from metal or stone can be easily built by the dwarves, the best goods to trade with them are those that they have difficulty producing in sufficient amounts, such as food and textiles.
      Jihad Ship: |
        Dwarves in space are linked by blood and faith, such that any attack on a dwarven ship may be taken as an attack on the entire dwarven race. Every so often a council of kings and priests of the combined dwarven pantheons will gather together and declare a crusade against a people, sphere, or race. An enemy is declared anathema, and their ships and people are attacked on sight. Currently the neogi are the object of a dwarven jihad, although many other races also attack the neogi on sight. When a jihad is declared, several Citadels usually choose to actively follow the crusade rather than simply fighting the enemy if encountered. Such a jihad ship will have a large contingent of forge-tenders (maximum SR for the ship's size), double the normal numbers of heavy weapons, and also a large number of heavily armed and well-trained soldiers under the command of a fighter of at least 6th level (8th-10th level is more common). Jihad ships actively seek out enemy vessels and outposts, strafe them, board them, and slaughter those aboard to a man.
    Other Configurations:
      Abandoned Citadels: |
        The forges that power dwarven Citadels require a large amount of raw material to work properly. After a number of years (usually about 10-20 years per 100 tons of the ship), the Citadel's resources are exhausted and the people must find a new home. Once an asteroid of appropriate size is located, the forges are packed up and moved to their new home. Only then does construction begin on the new base. After one month per 100 tons of asteroid, the new Citadel has enough space to support the new population. At this point the old Citadel is abandoned. Abandoned Citadels are frequently used as bases and lairs by other spaceborne races and creatures. Former Citadels may be the home of pirates, monsters, smugglers, or any number of other creatures. Given the size of the largest Citadels, multiple monsters and groups can hold portions of a single Citadel, sometimes working together, and sometimes in conflict. Since Citadels are not always completely stripped before being abandoned, they usually attract adventurers like a magnet. If the Citadel's population is sufficiently large at the time of abandonment, more than one asteroid may be selected, with the ships forges and population being split between the two craft, allowing each side to pursue its own course. Similarly, dying kingdoms, torn by war or disease, may be swept up by groups in larger Citadels, leaving abandoned ships that are not fully exploited.
      Gnomish Citadels: |
        Gnomish Citadels are to dwarven Citadels what gnomish Sidewheelers are to normal ships - a bad satire. Abandoned dwarven Citadels are often taken over by gnomes , who simulate the effects of the forges with their various gizmos. In reality their devices add nothing to the final output of the system, causing the ship to drift as aimlessly as when it was abandoned. Gnomes usually come up with careful explanations that detail why they wanted to go in the direction they are drifting anyway. Gnomish Citadels are generally avoided, since more than one has been seen to explode dramatically following failed experiments.

    Summary: |
      The Clipper is a spelljamming ship built by groundling humans and used by giff .
    Description: |
      The Clipper is the most advanced sailing ship found on any known world. It has three central hull masts, one aft mast, and a bow mast, with several lateral sails between the masts. Regardless of the fact that it has 29 individual sails, Clippers still suffer from poor handling in space due to their groundling construction. The ship's heavy maneuvering also diminishes the effectiveness of the helmsman, with this loss of function translating into a 1 point SR penalty for any helmsman (to a minimum SR 1).
      The first Clippers were designed by a groundling nation using giff mercenaries, and were intended as powerful warships, mounting the weaponry seen on most spacefaring Clippers. Most of the few groundling cultures that now produce Clippers, however, use them as fast, well-armed trading ships, typically mounting about two dozen ballistas . In space , however, the Clipper is not effective in this role, since the strengths which allow it to perform so well in the water are its unsurpassed speed and maneuverability; qualities that it loses in space. As a result, the Clipper sees virtually no use in space by humans, who prefer purpose-built vessels. The giff, however, love the design, using it in its original bombard-heavy configuration.
      Giff mount 12 bombards on each side of the main deck of a Clipper, giving it a truly devastating broadside attack. The giff also enjoy the fact that the ship's groundling construction can lull unwary attackers into a false sense of security, and they delight in pretending to be helpless until an enemy comes into close range of one of the Clipper's flanks. The few enemy craft who survive such a tactic never close with a Clipper again. The bow and aft of the Clipper have one turret-mounted bombard apiece. These were installed after the giff lost several ships to wiser pirates who chose to stay out of the Clipper's side firing arcs.
      There is one deadly drawback to these vessels. Whenever a fire critical hit is suffered by the Clipper for any reason, the vessel must make an immediate save vs. non-magical fire (using its metal rating). If this save fails, the fire immediately guts the deck, exposing the smokepowder stores below-decks. The next round, the ship will explode into a fireball so large that any ship in the same hex must make a saving throw vs. fire or suffer the effects of a 17d6 fireball. Additionally, if any attempt is made to land on anything other than water, the ship must save vs. crushing blow. If this save fails, the ship's hull cracks open, and the smokepowder stores will erupt in the same manner as if they had been ignited by fire. This includes any crash with another ship.
    Crew: |
      A typical Clipper carries a crew of 70. Since the giff are incapable of spelljamming themselves, they hire human mages to man the helm (usually invokers who are fond of spells that create explosions and loud noises); however the rest of the crew will be made up of giff. A crew of 70 of the large giff strains the air envelope somewhat; however it allows the ship and bombards to be fully manned (since they are larger and stronger than humans, each giff can do the work of one and a half men). Like any giff-operated vessel, a Clipper has a rigid chain of command, in which each giff knows his place.
    Ship Uses:
      Heavy Warship: |
        Clippers are the heavy warship of choice for the giff, although they are expensive to build, equip, and operate, making them fairly rare. Whenever possible, Clippers operate in packs of at least two. This allows them to operate in concert to ensure that a broadside attack can be made by one Clipper against a target in the front or rear firing arc of another. This practice has greatly diminished their losses since it was introduced.
      Command Vessel: |
        The Joint Chiefs of the Giff General Staff (JCGGS) use Clippers as command vessels for their fleets. Unlike the Clippers used as warships, which are typically hired out in pairs, those Clippers which have been designated as command vessels will only be hired out if the employer wishes to hire a fleet of 20 or more giff ships. Such a fleet would include 3-6 Clippers, one of which would be a command vessel. A Clipper command vessel will be commanded by a giff admiral, who will be a fighter of at least 13th level.
    Other Configurations:
      Merchantman: |
        A small number of Clippers in space are used by groundling humans as traders in the same fashion in which they are used on oceans. These Clippers do not typically carry bombards, and instead mount 12 light ballistas and 12 medium ballistas, with 6 of each type on the port side and on the starboard side. Sometimes a medium jettison will also be mounted on the stern castle to deter pursuit. A Merchantman Clipper can carry 40 tons of cargo (38 if a jettison is mounted), making it a respectable hauler. Despite this, the drawbacks of handling such a ship in space make the Merchantman Clipper very rare.

    Summary: |
      The Coaster is a spelljamming ship built and used by groundling humans .
    Description: |
      The Coaster is a groundling coastal trading ship, which is not intended for use in space. Sometimes used by those new to space travel, the Coaster makes a poor spelljammer. Coasters are very clumsy, suffering from poor maneuverability, and heavy handling which makes it difficult for a helmsman to operate. This results in a -1 penalty to SR (to a minimum SR 1). In addition, Coasters are poorly armoured, and require a large crew for their size. Most Coasters carry a single heavy weapon to deter pirates, however this is mostly for show, and the ship is very vulnerable to attack. Most spacefarers using a Coaster will upgrade to a more suitable spelljammer as soon as they can; assuming that they survive long enough.
    Crew: |
      When used as a spelljammer, a Coaster will typically carry a crew of about a dozen men. This is somewhat less than the 20 men which a Coaster usually carries when used as a sailing ship, but it is still more than the ship's air envelope can comfortably accomidate, making long journeys a poor idea.
    Ship Uses:
      Trader: |
        Most Coasters in space are used as trading vessels. The only advantage that such a ship has over more capable ships designed for spelljamming is the fact that a Coaster can land in the water, and trade with groundling ports without attracting undue attention. In some of the safest areas of space using a Coaster as a trading vessel is actually a viable option; however, most of wildspace is not safe for the ship, and even in those areas that are safe a Caravel would be a better choice.
    Other Configurations: |
      None: |
        Modifications to the Coaster are rare, since it is usually more cost-effective to simply purchase a better ship.

    Summary: |
      The Cog is a spelljamming ship built and used by groundling humans .
    Description: |
      The Cog is a groundling ocean trading ship, which is not intended for use in space. Cogs usually have a protected fore and aft castle intended to serve as archery platforms, but some will dispense with the forecastle entirely, and have an unprotected aft castle. Sometimes used by those new to space travel, the Cog makes a poor spelljammer. Cogs are very clumsy, suffering from poor maneuverability, and heavy handling which makes it difficult for a helmsman to operate. This results in a -1 penalty to SR (to a minimum SR 1). In addition, Cogs are poorly armoured, and are typically unarmed. Most spacefarers using a Cog will upgrade to a more suitable spelljammer as soon as they can; assuming that they survive long enough.
    Crew: |
      When used as a spelljammer, a Cog will typically carry a crew of about a dozen men. This is somewhat less than the 20 men which a Cog usually carries when used as a sailing ship, but unlike many groundling ships, it is actually capable of carrying its full groundling crew in space without unduly straining its air envelope. As a result, Cogs carrying a full 20 men are not uncommon.
    Ship Uses:
      Trader: |
        Most Cogs in space are used as trading vessels. The only advantage that such a ship has over more capable ships designed for spelljamming is the fact that a Cog can land in the water, and trade with groundling ports without attracting undue attention. In some of the safest areas of space using a Cog as a trading vessel is actually a viable option; however, most of wildspace is not safe for the ship, and even in those areas that are safe a Caravel would usually be a better choice. The only advantage that the Cog has over the Caravel is a greater cargo capacity.
    Other Configurations:
      Armed Trader: |
        An Armed Trader Cog will typically mount either a medium ballista in the forecastle and a medium catapult in the aft castle, or just a heavy catapult in the aft castle. In either case the cargo capacity drops to 6 tons. This modification is not particularly popular, since the reduction in cargo space cuts into profits, while the clumsy craft performs poorly in combat even when armed.

    Summary: |
      The Crystal Ship is a spelljamming ship built and used by humans .
    Description: |
      One of the most feared vessels in the Astromundi Cluster, the Crystal Ship is unknown outside that sphere. Within Clusterspace , the distinctive Crystal Ship is known and despised by all free races. The ship's main body looks very much like a bisected egg, round side down. The deck is open, but angularly-curving spines rise from the craft's sides like great ribs. Some of these spines serve as mounts for light ballista platforms, while others are used to support the sunsails that make the Crystal Ship so formidable. The whole vessel is built from incredibly strong translucent crystal which reflects light in dazzling shards of rainbow illumination. Anyone attacking a Crystal Ship when it is in full sunlight suffers a -1 attack modifier.
      The magical sunsails that are standard equipment on every Crystal Ship can only be used when the vessel is in full direct sunlight, and only the sun of the Astromundi Cluster provides the proper energy. When the sunsails are used, they increase the Crystal Ship's SR by a full 3 points, making it one of the fastest ships in the Cluster. Unfortunately, with the sunsails deployed, the ship is much less maneuverable, making the decision to use them a difficult one for the Crystal Ship's captain.
    Crew: |
      Often carrying as many as 70 heavily armed men, Crystal Ships are incredibly dangerous to attack, not in the least because every officer on board will be an experienced sun mage. Typically a Crystal Ship will carry 10 officers, while the rest of the crew will be veteran warriors.
    Ship Uses:
      Warship: |
        Crystal Ships are weapons of war, and serve little other purpose. They are never used as trading vessels, as the Antilans prefer to hire out such menial tasks to "lesser" races. Although well-armed in conventional terms, the true danger of the Crystal Ship comes from the magical skills of the sun mages who operate it, with the result that Crystal Ships rarely suffer defeats.
    Other Configurations:
      Additional Weaponry: |
        It is common for Crystal Ships to carry additional weaponry, frequently as much as 10 tons worth, which will sometimes include a grappling_ram . It should be noted that the Antilans shun technology, and will only use ballistas, catapults , and jettisons on their vessels.

    Summary: |
      The Cuttle Command is a spelljamming ship built and used by humans .
    Description: |
    Designed by the same humans who allied with the illithids to create the Octopus , the Cuttle Command was built using several of the features of the Octopus, but without the direct input of illithid designers. As the name suggests, the Cuttle Command was intended as a command vessel to coordinate human vessels during the first Unhuman_War . The Cuttle Command is a ten-story-tall tower in space. It is even taller than it is wide along its hull. The gravity plane is maintained by the eight large tentacles, four of which mount heavy weapons. These tentacles extend far enough horizontally to change the orientation of the gravity plane, however this results in a ship which is less maneuverable than it could be otherwise. These tentacles can be pulled in close to the ship in an emergency, granting the Cuttle Command a maneuverability class of C, however this is rarely done, since the sudden shift in the gravity plane is disastrous for anything and anyone not strapped down.
      The Cuttle Command was to be the answer to the elven Armada , proof that an organized human community could create great command ships to destroy the humanoid menace. Unfortunately, the human organization proved to be far less cohesive than that of the elves. In the one large battle of the Unhuman War in which Cuttles participated, they appeared on both sides. Turncoat mercenaries seized one ship and turned it against its builders.
    Crew: |
      The Cuttle Command was set up as a command vessel and information centre, with the "brains" hidden within the protective shell. The Cuttle Command could support a full fleet command staff, and included about half its number in heavily-armed raiders and defenders. Historically, Cuttle Commands were well-armed with magic as well, typically carrying about a dozen battle mages. The captain of such a ship was usually also a powerful mage rather than a warrior.
    Ship Uses:
      Command Ship: |
        Only about a score of Cuttle Commands were originally built, and all of these were intended to serve as command ships for human fleets opposing the goblinkin. These mobile command bases were never really intended to serve directly in combat, but were sufficiently armed to defend themselves if the other ships in the fleet were unable to prevent an enemy from reaching them. While some impetuous captains and admirals piloted their Cuttles directly into enemy formations, the ship was actually designed to coordinate the attacks of other ships from a distance. To this end, a Cuttle Command was typically equipped with magical devices to allow long-range communication with the ships under its command. Some Cuttle Commands are still used in this function today.
      Wizard's Ship: |
        The tower-like configuration of the Cuttle Command tends to appeal to human wizards, and the design quickly spread to powerful mages on many worlds through a network of magical contacts. This has resulted in new Cuttle Commands periodically appearing in space as wizards decide to build the craft as experiments. Such ships are usually piloted and captained by the wizard who built them. Since such powerful wizards are often fairly solitary in nature, the rest of the crew is often made up primarily (or even entirely) of magical servants and constructs. These Cuttles are typically used by their masters for research, solitude, and exploration. Because the nature of the crew is so variable, experienced spacers tend to avoid lone Cuttle Commands, since it is impossible to guess what they may be facing if hostilities erupt, and since it is equally impossible to guess what actions may cause hostilities to erupt!
    Other Configurations:
      Alternate Weapons: |
        The Cuttle Command's precarious gravity plane simultaneously cries out for modification at the same time that it makes such modification extremely difficult. Extensive modifications to the hull or rigging tend to unbalance the ship, with tragic results, unless performed by a master shipwright with an exceptionally skilled team of workers. As a result, the only common modification seen in Cuttle Commands is a change in weaponry. The most common variants are those which carry all ballistas , or all catapults . There was a Cuttle Command armed with multiple greek_fire_projectors , the Ultimate_Victory ; however it was destroyed in a mutiny when the mutineers captured a weapons platform and turned it against the ship. Some Cuttle Commands mount additional heavy weapons on the observation platforms on decks one and ten, while one notable Cuttle, the Battle_Cry , was also equipped with extra weapons platforms on the four lower tentacles, carrying a total of 6 heavy ballistas, 6 heavy catapults, and 2 heavy jettisons . The Battle Cry survived the first Unhuman War, and has been successfully used as a mobile defense platform ever since.

    Summary: |
      The Damselfly is a spelljamming ship built by humans and used by humans and illithids .
    Description: |
      A second-generation version of the standard Dragonfly , the Damselfy has the same general configuration, but has been totally redesigned along its main body. The thin wood "skin" of the vessel has been replaced with metal and other similarly hard substances, and all exposed decks have been covered. A sliding hatch just behind the wings is used for the Damselfly's single heavy weapon.
    Crew: |
      Refinements in the layout of the Damselfly's wings reduce the number of crew needed to efficiently operate the ship to two. The helm is usually located on the enclosed bridge, behind a forward portal of glass, crystal, or metal affected with a glassteel spell. As with the Dragonfly, the Damselfly's captain and spelljammer usually both serve in any other positions as needed. Often Damselfly captains will be loners, operating the ship much as a hermit's ship, shutting the universe out.
    Ship Uses:
      Small Fighter: |
        Although the Damselfly's maneuverability is relatively poor for a ship in its size class, it is well-armoured and carries relatively heavy firepower for a ship its size. As a result, Damselflies are sometimes carried by larger ships to serve as scout/fighters. These ships will often be used to cover the retreat of the parent ship if needed, rejoining the main ship at a rendezvous point later if possible. Such ships often sacrifice cargo space to carry additional weapons.
      Wizard's Ship: |
        The Damselfly appeals to solitary wizards engaging in research for the same reasons that the Dragonfly does, and is used in a similar fashion. The Damselfly has the advantage of being better-protected than the Dragonfly, and it requires fewer servants to operate at peak efficiency.
      Monster's Ship: |
        The small size, protection, and ease of operation of the Damselfy makes it an ideal craft for generally solitary, nasty creatures. The fact that an observer cannot tell if the ship carries a wizard, lich, or rakshasa provides a level of comfort for the user.
      Smuggling: |
        Most smugglers prefer the more maneuverable Dragonfly as a smuggling vessel, but in areas in which a blockade must be run to complete a mission, the better-protected Damselfly is preferred.
      Ship's Boat: |
        As with the Dragonfly, the Damselfly is sometimes stripped of its spelljamming helm and used as a ship's boat. Such shuttles are useful for short runs from a mother ship to a planetary surface and back, however most captains prefer the Dragonfly or the Mosquito for this purpose.
      Mind Flayer Scout: |
        The enclosed, protected nature of the Damselfly appeals to illithid sensibilities, and the ships have been used as scouts and planetary landers by the mind flayers. While illithids generally prefer their own ship designs, the Damselfly is seen as an acceptable alternative for use in situations requiring subtlety, when an obviously illithid-operated vessel might attract too much attention.
    Other Configurations:
      Super-Heavy Damselfly: |
        In the quest for still more protection, a modified Super-Heavy Damselfly has appeared. The ship is given extra armour plating, increasing AR to 3, but giving the ship a very poor MC E, making it hard to manage in a fight. These ships have generally only performed well in combat against groundling vessels, and have quickly gained a reputation as 'full-plate coffins.'
      Alternate Shell: |
        Enameled metal is the common covering of the Damselfly, often painted in bright colour to warn other ships away. Versions built by some space-based humans use bone, ceramics, or shells to the same effect. All of the ship's characteristics remain the same, except that the ship's saving throws are changed to that of the new material.

    Summary: |
    The Deathglory is a spelljamming ship built and used by gnomes .
    Description: |
    The Deathglory, also known as the Dreadnever-class Galley, is a gnomish ship that actually works. These top-heavy ships are ruggedly overbuilt and equipped with the best gnomish weapons and technology. Deathglories are equipped with outrigger weapon spars jutting from their sides to allow for greater fields of fire.
    Crew: |
    The crew sizes given above are for human-sized crew. For gnomes the crew sizes are 18/90 (weapon crew sizes are also increased by 50%). Recent Deathglory successes have greatly bolstered gnome morale, creating gung-ho crews who work together with speed, dedication, and a degree of common sense not normally seen in tinker gnomes. Some gnome captains have hired human wizards to helm their Deathglories. Experienced gnome gunners and spacers known as "trusties" command groups of 4-7 crewmen each. Most Deathglories carry about 60-70 gnomes.
    Ship Uses:
    Battleship: The armament of these ships announces their war-like purpose to all. Their gear includes spark_darts , glass globes (filled with greek fire, puddings, jellies, or oozes), ballista-fired supersweepers, tangle_line_guns , water_cannons , and spell_reflectors . Heavy metal plating covers the whole ship, many of which have shields to conceal and protect weapons not in use. Deathglories are kept busy escorting gnomish merchant ships through dangerous areas, hunting pirates along important trade routes, and exploring in the_flow in search of new spheres for the gnomes to colonize. These vessels are still rare, but have become the backbone of gnomish navies, guarding the richest, most populous gnome colonies.
    Other Configurations:
    Ramglory: This trouble-plagued version of the Deathglory mounts an incredible four rams. The lower half of the prow has been strengthened and reinforced to serve as a blunt_ram , while a piercing ram has been mounted above this. The rear of the ship has been given a similar arrangement. The intent is that the spelljammer can use the blunt ram against ships that the gnomes would not wish to get involved in a boarding action, and the piercing ram against ships that they want to board. In practice, it is very difficult to hit a ship with one ram, while avoiding the use of the other (unless the to-hit roll succeeds by more than 6 points determine randomly which ram is actually used). The rear rams are obviously intended to attack ships behind the Ramglory - which in practice rarely happens, partly because enemy ships can readily see the rams, and so tend to avoid following the Ramglory too closely. The Ramglory is not a popular configuration, since the placement of the rams makes it impossible to properly reinforce the hull to stand the stresses of ramming. Any time a Ramglory rams a ship larger than 15 tons it automatically suffers 1d3 randomly determined critical hits.
    Flow Galley: The Flow Galley uses a typical Deathglory hull that's been topped out, drops the ballistas and one water cannon, and uses a major helm. The resulting craft has MC: C, 28 tons of cargo space, and requires 27 gnomes to handle. Flow Galleys usually tow several cargo_barges (often overloaded with strange and unreliable gnomish gear) to allow for increased range. Flow Galleys so equipped are used for long-range exploration far beyond the known spheres. Relatively few Flow Galleys have been built, and as of yet none have returned to known space . Likely some of the ships have met with bad fates, but the rest are probably simply still exploring, or have just not yet completed the long journey home.
    Non-Gnome Crew: The Deathglory is the only gnomish-built ship which other races tend to be willing to use. These ships are usually slightly modified to remove the strangest gnome gear (typically the tangle line guns and water cannons are replaced with more conventional weapons), but are otherwise unchanged from the standard Deathglory.

    Summary: |
    The Deathspider is a spelljamming ship built and used by neogi .
    Description: |
    One of the largest of the standard ships of space , the all-too-common Deathspider is the pride and joy of the neogi. Its large size and distinctive shape make the Deathspider easily recognizable in space. As a result, it is usually attacked (or avoided if possible) on sight. The neogi Deathspider is divided into the command section and the cargo pits. The command section is in the forward portion of the vessel and contains the bridge, the helm, and the quarters and possessions of the most important neogi aboard. The larger "abdomen" of the craft is used as weapons platform, cargo space, and slaves' quarters (including the quarters of the lesser neogi). The top half of the abdomen can slide back to reveal a small citadel perched on the lower haunches. This structure is normally revealed only in battle situations, since the Deathspider's weapons are located there. The forward weapons pit of the citadel deck is also the source of boarding parties when the grappling_ram captures an enemy ship.
    Crew: |
    A typical Deathspider will carry 8 neogi, each of whom has a personal umber_hulk slave. Additional slaves, umber hulk and otherwise, make up the remainder of the standard 30-man crew, as well as the weapons crews. In total, a Deathdpider will usually carry about 60 or 70 crew, made up of 8 neogi, and 10-16 umber hulks, with the remainder of the crew being humanoid slaves of various races, with humans being the most common. It should be noted that for air considerations a neogi uses half the air of a man-sized creature, while an umber hulk uses twice as much. The result is that a crew of 60 will use about as much air as 66-72 normal men, depending on the number of umber hulks aboard. The most important neogi aboard will be the captain-owner, who will usually also have some spelllcasting ability. The spelljammer is the second-most powerful neogi on the Deathspider (although he is still considered to be a slave of the captain) and will typically be a 6th-8th level mage. The rest of the neogi are lowly slaves, but they can aspire to gain more slaves of their own, and may even become ship owners one day, holding other neogi in their thrall. The non-neogi slaves have no such hope. Should the captain of a Deathspider be slain, the remaining neogi will vote on a new captain. Politicking is intense in these elections, and the neogi with the most powerful umber hulk servant will usually be the winner. In boarding actions the personal umber hulk slaves of the lesser neogi are used as shock troops, supported by the humanoid slaves, and sometimes the lesser neogi as well. Since all creatures in the universe are seen as either slaves or potential slaves, boarding actions are extremely common in order to capture more slaves.
    Ship Uses:
    Neogi Workhorse: The Deathspider is the most common neogi craft, and serves as a cargo hauler, battle wagon, discovery ship, and slave trader. Since all Deathspiders tend to look identical regardless of their function, it is not easy to determine if a given Deathspider is fitted for exploring, or actively hunting for slaves. As a result, all Deathspiders are usually either attacked or evaded, whichever the defending ship is most capable of doing.
    Broodship: Those neogi fortunate enough to reach the end of their natural lifespans become Great Old Masters. These old neogi grow to prodigious sizes, and must consume massive amounts of flesh, preferably live, in order to nourish the young neogi growing within their distended abdomens. When this occurs, the Deathspider carrying the Great Old Master is temporarily transformed into a broodship. The cargo pits are cleared to make room for the Great Old Master, and a pen is built for it, with a protective dome so that the abdomen dome can still be retracted when weapons need to be deployed. A broodship is driven by the hunger of the Great Old Master, and will usually attack any ship it encounters in order to provide live food.
    Carrier: Some Deathspiders use the additional cargo area of the flight deck to carry a number of small Urchin craft, which can then be used in combat. As many as 20 Urchins may be carried by a Deathspider, and as battles with elven Armadas have destroyed more and more Deathspiders, the use of Urchins to counter the elven Flitters has beome more and more common.
    Other Configurations:
    Hulks: Deathspider hulks are available for sale from the neogi, but since they are not the best ships to be seen in, they are not a popular seller. Those few purchasers who do end up with a Deathspider hulk on their hands tend to strip the ship, removing the legs and sails, while pulling back the dome, or removing it entirely. The hulk is then usually used as an orbiting weapons platform to defend an asteroid base.
    Black Widow: Most neogi do not engage in modifying their vessels, using the same configuration regardless of the ship's purpose. The exception to this rule is the Black Widow - a specialized version for use as an attack and retribution craft against enemies who have defeated the neogi in the past. The Black Widow triples the number of ballistas and catapults usually found on a Deathspider. Most of these extra weapons are housed on a large weapons platform which is built on top of the command section and in front of the foreward weapons pit on the citadel deck. The remainder are placed in the flight deck facing aft. In some cases the bridge will be moved to deep within the abdomen, and the former bridge area will be used as a weapons pit for 1-3 greek_fire_projectors or bombards . A Black Widow will have a mere 10 tons of cargo capacity; less if greek fire projectors or bombards are included as well. These ships also usually overload on crew, requiring a full crew of at least 97 just to man all of the weapons. This overloading does not concern the neogi, since the slaves that survive the battle will typically be eaten on the return trip. Black Widows are never used for any purpose other than warfare. There are rumoured to be as many as a hundred of these ships, but the most that have ever been seen at any time is three, and in this case two attacked each other in a dispute over ownership of the fleet.
    Mind Flayer Trader: The only races that have any regular dealings with the neogi are the arcane and the mind_flayers . The former have no known ships, and the latter have their own fleets of Nautiloids and Dreadnoughts . Still, several Deathspiders have been traded to illithids in exchange for large slave hauls. Unfortunately for the illithids, the universal hatred of the neogi is such that these ships are subject to immediate attack from most other ships, without waiting to see what race actually controls the ship. Illithid Deathspiders blacken the dome to spare the mind flayers the light of the suns , and do not retract the dome even in combat. Instead, external weapons platforms are fitted in several locations, to be manned by slaves. Since the introduction of the illithid Dreadnought, no new Deathspiders have been purchased by mind flayers.

    Summary: |
    The Dolphin is a spelljamming ship built by humans and used by humans and elves .
    Description: |
    The graceful Battle Dolphin is the latest human ship to appear in any quantity in the void. It combines a number of design features that make it a highly versatile ship. The bulk of the Battle Dolphin is enclosed to protect the crew. While this limits the number of weapons emplacements aboard the Dolphin, most crews consider the protection to be worth it. The Battle Dolphin maintains an upper surveillance level which places it above the decks of opposing ships. Most importantly, the galleonlike portion of the upper deck can separate from the main ship and make planetary landings. This Dolphin Shuttle is designed for handling in space ; however it appears to be a small groundling ship. This makes it easy to trade with groundlings without attracting undue attention. While the Dolphin Shuttle is very small, it carries far more cargo than most ships its size, making it very useful for short trading trips.
    Crew: |
    The crew configuration of a Battle Dolphin depends largely on whether the ship's owner can afford a second helm for the Dolphin Shuttle. If not, then a single major_helm is used for both ships, and is mounted on the Shuttle. The Dolphin Shuttle becomes the bridge for the entire ship, and holds the command officers. If two helms are used, the Battle Dolphin bridge and officers are found on the officers' deck, necessitating a second crew for the Dolphin Shuttle. Typically in this configuration the first mate will serve as the commanding officer for the Dolphin Shuttle. The Battle Dolphin can operate with a surprisingly small crew for a ship its size, leaving room for a significant number of passengers or boarding troops, depending on the ship's use. While most Battle Dolphins are operated by human crews, the Imperial Elven Navy has deemed the ship suitable for elven use. Elven crews are arranged along strict military lines, and will always include a second helm for the Dolphin Shuttle.
    Ship Uses:
    Trader: The Battle Dolphin, despite the name, was actually designed to serve as a trade vessel. The main ship can carry large cargos between space ports, while the Dolphin Shuttle allows for easy trade with groundlings. The Battle Dolphin is an unpopular target for pirate attacks, since the ship is capable of defending itself adequately in ship-to-ship combat, and since it frequently carries large numbers of marines. The enclosed nature of the ship makes it impossible for even a sharp-eyed, experienced lookout to guess at how many warriors may be on board.
    Warship: The versatility of the Battle Dolphin has made it a popular addition to many navies. While it is not as hard-hitting as the more common Hammership , it can still be highly effective in battle. Most importantly, a Battle Dolphin serves as an excellent support vessel while still being capable of defending itself, making an escort unnecessary. In a fleet, Battle Dolphins will most frequently serve either as supply ships, or as troop transports. Some military Battle Dolphins use Dolphin Shuttles that have been armed, typically with either a single medium catapult or ballista, in order to provide more versatility in combat. Elven Battle Dolphins usually carry several Flitters in addition to the Dolphin Shuttle, using the rear balcony as a docking area.
    Adventurer's Ship: The versatility of the Battle Dolphin, along with the low crew requirements, makes the vessel popular with adventurers and other small parties. The ability of the Dolphin Shuttle to land on worlds without attracting attention is the primary attraction of this craft, however, since adventurers often have missions which require subtlety. At the same time, the powerful Battle Dolphin in orbit provides the firepower that is needed if subtlety fails. Most adventurers operate Battle Dolphins with fairly small crews, typically made up of the adventuring party itself, along with a few trusted retainers.
    Other Configurations:
    Narwhal: Since the Battle Dolphin is still a new ship, few other configurations have become common (although owners often change the weaponry to suit their needs). The exception to this is the Narwhal. The Narwhal adds a piercing ram attached to the forward bridge, removing the windows in the process. These ships tend to be used solely as warships, and often include extra weaponry. Narwhals can be truly deadly ships, and have quickly gained a dangerous reputation.

    Summary: |
    The Doombat is a spelljamming ship built and used by elves .
    Description: |
    A recent development, the Doombat has emerged from lessons learned during the second Unhuman_War . While depowered Flitters have long served the Imperial Elven Navy well as fighters, they lack large weapons to damage enemy vessels, and instead rely on carried archers and wizards to kill enemy crews. This tactic did not work as well against the scro attackers as it has against most enemies of the elves, since scro ships tend to have few exposed decks, thus providing few targets. Against other enemies with enclosed vessels (like the illithids and the neogi ), the elves typically pounded their ships at range with the medium weapons of their larger vessels. Unfortunately for the elves, the scro Mantis was specifically designed to fight elven vessels, and is usually capable of closing with an opposing elven craft, and then doing horrific damage at close range with its grapples and razors. The elves needed a small fighter craft capable of damaging an enemy ship without crashing into it in a suicide attack.
    The result of this need is the Doombat. Designed as a heavy fighter, the Doombat is able to out-maneuver scro ships (and, with its boat helm, it can usually out-run them as well), and also cause significant damage on close passes with its greek_fire_projector . Importantly, the design of the Doombat's integrated weapon pods allows them to be rotated quickly and easily to face any enemy, which can often spell the difference between victory and defeat.
    Doombats are much larger than Flitters, and therefore take significantly longer to grow, although they can still be grown much more quickly than any other elven ships. Since they are so new, and since elven shipyards have already been pushed beyond capacity, Doombats are rare ships, and are currently exclusively used by the Imperial Elven Navy. Not even friendly elven organizations such as the Sindiath Line, or regional elven kingdoms are allowed to purchase Doombats.
    Crew: |
    A Doombat typically carries a full 5 elves: one pilot and four weaponeers. If possible at least one of the weaponeers will also be a mage or priest who can serve as a backup helmsman or magical support in combat as needed. The pilot of a Doombat is also its captain, and will typically be a young, brave, and ambitious elven fighter/mage who burns to strike back at the scro and their allies. The rest of the crew will typically have similar attitudes, and will often be amongst the most elite warriors available. Doombat crews are often considered to be too wild and unpredictable by their superiors; however these very traits make them useful in the role for which the ship was designed.
    Ship Uses:
    Heavy Fighter: The primary purpose of the Doombat is to serve as a heavy fighter, attacking enemy ships with or without the support of Flitters and larger elven ships. In this role, Doombats are usually carried by larger elven ships, either Men-o-War or Armadas, and do not tend to operate independently. Doctrine calls for Doombats to be deployed in pairs, and it is believed that this doctrine has gone a long way towards keeping losses very low. If a Man-o-War carries Doombats, it will not carry more than two of the rare craft (typically the Doombats will be lashed underneath the base of the Man-o-War's wings), while an Armada equipped with the ships will not carry more than four (each Doombat carried will replace five Flitters).
    Blockade Runner: In some cases, Doombats have been used in enemy-controlled space for quick insertions and extractions of key personnel or equipment. The small ship can easily slip past virtually all enemy patrols, and is fast, agile, and well-armed, giving it an excellent chance of succeeding in its mission even if a patrol does catch it. The success of the Doombat in these military missions has piqued the interest of many smugglers, who would dearly love to get their hands on one for themselves.
    Other Configurations:
    Boombat: One experimental version of the Doombat mounts a pair of bombards in its weapons pods (reducing cargo capacity to a single ton). Field tests have shown the so-called Boombat to be a deadly and demoralizing attack craft; however it is unlikely that the IEN will produce any further Boombats. This is because fully half of the prototypes have been lost after their powder magazines exploded in battle. Nevertheless, the giff have expressed interest in these ships.

    The Dragon Claw is a spelljamming ship formerly captained by a woman named Elsun , the last known owner of Blackjammer's_Cutlass . Elsun was killed when the Dragon Claw was attacked by an elven Man-O-War . It is believed that the Cutlass fell overboard during the battle and is still drifting through the_phlogiston , but it is not known if the ship itself was destroyed or simply captured.

    Summary: |
    The Dragonfly is a spelljamming ship built by humans and used by humans and elves .
    Description: |
    The Dragonfly, along with the Tradesman , is one of the workhorses of space. Its size and maneuverability make it ideal for transporting small groups, important persons, and small packages. These features also make the Dragonfly an ideal ship for smuggling and exploration.
    The Dragonfly is also a good choice for a wizard's ship. A mage can load a significant number of supplies on board and turn the Dragonfly into a mobile laboratory and workshop, placing himself literally millions of miles from nowhere. There he can work in relative peace. A large number of Dragonfly hulks found in various systems were once used for this purpose, abandoned when their masters moved on or died as a result of their experiments.
    Crew: |
    The Dragonfly is capable of being handled by a single man, although the maneuverability of the craft suffers greatly, and it is better operated with a three-man crew. The captain is usually also the quartermaster and navigator, while the first officer is usually also the helmsman. Other positions are filled as needed by whatever crew is available. The crew of a wizard's ship is usually made up of the wizard owner, along with a small number of trusted servants, which are frequently magical in nature (golems and other constructs are popular, as are undead and sometimes summoned creatures).
    Ship Uses:
    Smuggling: The "light package" trade is a favorable one for spacefarers. Those who wish to send items such as magical tomes, artifacts, magical items, or other valuables to other planets or spheres without passing through the various planes of existence find black market traders very helpful. Smuggling ships are often stripped down for maneuverability and powered by a high-level wizard for speed. The stripped-down Dragonfly has MC B, but its AR is reduced to a very fragile 10.
    Free Adventuring: The Dragonfly is an ideal small exploration ship for adventurers who are looking to land on a planet, scout around, and leave at will. Although it cannot land on water like the Mosquito , it does have an advantage in this usage over the Mosquito - being slightly larger it can carry larger amounts of treasure away (although it is still too small to carry large objects), and can carry slightly larger parties.
    Wizard's Ship: Such Dragonflies are usually gutted and redesigned from within to suit the needs of the wizard. Wizards who do not frequently venture into the_phlogiston will often create extradimensional spaces aboard their ships to provide extra storage space. A wizard's ship will often carry no large weapons, as the wizard himself is usually the most dangerous weapon on board.
    Ship's Boat: A Dragonfly may be stripped of its helm in favour of a more conventional power source, and used as a "ship's boat" by a larger vessel (although the Mosquito is usually considered a better choice for this function). Sometimes such a ship will retain its helm and will also serve as a scout and light fighter.
    Other Configurations:
    Firefly: This version of the Dragonfly is used in desperate naval actions. The Firefly is nothing more than a large bomb, as the ship will be armed with either a bombard or greek_fire_projector and packed to the gills with ammunition and other flammables. The idea is for the ship to be piloted into the heart of an enemy armada and detonated by crashing into a larger ship. The pilot and any crew will sometimes be provided with a lifeboat or dimensional escape device.
    Heavy Dragonfly: Occasionally, more armour is added to the Dragonfly, improving AR to 7, but reducing MC to D. Most individuals seeking a better protected ship will instead look to the second-generation Damselfly craft instead.
    Fighterfly: Some Dragonflies have been used as light combat craft. These ships sacrifice most of their cargo space to mount a total of 4 light weapons (usually catapults ), and harass enemy ships at long range. These ships are usually topped-out for increased maneuverability, and will operate in support of larger craft. The Imperial Elven Navy is particularly fond of this configuration, often using it in support of their Armadas and Men-o-War in fleet actions.

    Summary: |
    The Dragonship is a spelljamming ship built and used by humans .
    Description: |
    Most groundling nations give little thought to the empires that battle in space above their heads, if they are even aware of them. There is the occasional upstart nation or magocracy that turns its attention to the stars, but these efforts are usually short-lived since internal pressures do them in, or they find themselves unable to compete with other spacefaring nations. As a result, major efforts to reach space are usually only achieved by worlds with a single ruler. One of the exceptions to this general rule is the so-called "oriental" lands of the world of Toril , particularly the nations of Shou_Lung and Wa . Based in an area with large populations, and long-lived ruling organizations with efficient bureaucracies, the eastern nations of Toril have dabbled with space travel.
    Shou Lung's approach to space exploration is fairly typical of the oriental nations throughout known space. While "western" nations are unaware of space travel, dismiss it, or turn their attentions to more militaristic ends, the oriental nation pushes its experimentation with space forward. The Dragonship of Shou Lung is an example of such experimentation, and reflects the mindset of an organized groundling nation reaching into space.
    The Dragonship is boatish, and has some disadvantages over ship designs used by other spacefarers, but it performs significantly better than converted groundling ships, and can be easily constructed by shipwrights who only have experience with building groundling ships (particularly if the shipwrights have experience with building Junks and similar vessels). The helm of this ship is located belowdecks in the rear, with overhead domes allowing a view of space. The large structure on deck is a shrine to the crew's venerated gods and ancestors, to the Path and the Way, and to the emperor, by whose hand the mission is set into effect.
    Not one Shou native in 10,000 knows of the Dragonships, as their numbers and missions are for the ears of the emperor only. Dragonship captains all swear to come and go in secret. Despite this, some other nations have discovered the existence of Dragonships. These nations have either stolen ships, or created their own so that they can contest the Shou in the new arena of space. Conversely, some other oriental nations throughout the spheres have adopted the Dragonship design after encountering Shou vessels, since the ship suits their needs and temperament for the same reason that it suits the Shou.
    Crew: |
    A typical Shou Dragonship has both a captain and a helmsman, but arguably the most important post on a Shou ship belongs to the recorder. The recorder's task is to keep notes on all encounters, collect specimens and trophies, and to act as the official diplomat from Shou Lung. To that end, each recorder is given a number of blank scrolls of official greeting from the emperor. The recorder is empowered to fill in the name of the appropriate race or nation and present them. The crew chosen to man a Shou Dragonship are single men used to long voyages. They are armed with repeating crossbows, a groundling invention that has found great favour in space, making Shou crews both respected and feared.
    Ship Uses:
    Exploration: The chief mission of a Shou Dragonship is to seek out the unusual, the odd, and the new, and bring it back to the spiritual center of the universe (the emperor's palace in Shou Lung). Many wonders from the spheres have been brought back to Shou Lung in this manner. The presence of other spelljamming races intrigues the Shou, and they are particularly interested in accumulating more spelljammer helms. The ultimate goal - according to the bureaucrats on the missions - is to make the celestial bureaucracy truly celestial. There have been several waves of Shou Dragonships commissioned and set loose among the stars, as the "scholars of the stars" fall into and out of favour with the court. There is currently a lull in interest in the stars in Shou Lung, but with the return of new ships with rich treasures and the rising interest of other lords, it is only a matter of time before a new wave of Dragonships sails the spheres.
    Colonization: When exploring Dragonships find locations that would make particularly profitable colonies, once they return home they are usually outfitted to return and set up just such a colony. A Dragonship on a colonization mission will have its cargo bay packed full of everything that the new colony will need to become self-sufficient as soon as possible, and will carry as many as 100 colonists in addition to its regular crew. The ship becomes incredibly cramped and uncomfortable, and the air envelope must usually be refreshed on a regular basis through spells such as Fog Cloud. Depending on the size of the colony to be created, additional colony ships may or may not be sent.
    Free Adventuring: A large number of captains and recorders exposed to the marvels of arcane space suddenly wonder why they would throw in with some small-time emperor when there are whole worlds out there to be discovered, or even conquered. The result is a large number of dragonships no longer loyal to the emperor, cruising around the spheres, taking what they need. Such ships end up in the hands of adventurers, merchants, pirates, and other "free agents" of space. These ships reflect their owners' needs - added armour or increased maneuverability, more weapons (typically up to 3 more large weapons, but even more are not unheard of), and alternate power sources. Most Dragonships used by nations other than Shou Lung are the result of disloyal captains who have been paid by these other nations to allow them to examine and copy their ships (the rest are simply Dragonships that have been captured, or new Dragonships based on those that have been captured).
    Other Configurations:
    Flaming Dragons: The Shou who take to space in Dragonships (especially those who have turned freebooter) have a love for bombards and greek_fire_projectors matched only by that of the lizard_men and giff . Such destructive weapons appeal greatly to these newcomers to space, and often all of the weapons on board are of this type, with a significant amount of cargo space taken up by shot and shell. As a result of this dangerous tendency, there are significantly fewer Dragonships in space than there might be if their captains favoured carrying safer weapons. Another result, however, is that Dragonships tend to be approached cautiously; if a Dragonship proves to be a Flaming Dragon it may be dangerous to itself, but it is also dangerous to any other ship that comes too close.
    Battle Dragon: This version of the Dragonship was developed in response to the perceived threat of the Wa Tsunami (although it should be noted that the Battle Dragon is fairly poorly suited to defend itself from the tactics of the massive Tsunamis and their swarms of Locusts - luckily for the Shou the Tsunamis have had their attention largely focused on the Armadas of the elves ). A Battle Dragon has the dragon-head prow rebuilt and strengthened to the point where it can be used as a piercing ram - the hull and keel of the ship require surprisingly little modification to allow the ship to hold up to the rigours of ramming. In addition, the hull is thickened and braced internally to provide better protection. The weaponry of the Battle Dragon has been significantly upgraded, with a greek fire projector mounted in a protected turret on the scout's deck, and a pair of turreted medium catapults on the drill deck. Often the medium ballistas at the fore of the temple deck will be replaced with bombards . The resulting craft has AR 4, but has a reduced cargo capacity of only 8 tons. The few Battle Dragons that have been built stay grounded in case they must be called upon to defend Shou Lung.

    Summary: |
    The Drakkar is a spelljamming ship built and used by groundling humans .
    Description: |
    The Drakkar is a large longship used by Viking peoples. It requires more people to operate than its tonnage can comfortably support, and therefore is not a good ship for long voyages. Being a groundling vessel, the Drakkar suffers from poor maneuverability, although since it is designed for combat it does have a stronger hull than many groundling ships. Since these ships were designed to be powered by oars on water, and since they require large crews in any case, Oars of the Void are a popular method for powering them in space .
    Crew: |
    When used as a sea-going vessel, a Drakkar typically has a crew of 60-80 men, and will carry as many as 160 warriors. If this many were carried into space, they would quickly suffocate. Instead, a space-going Drakkar usually carries about 40 men, which is still many more than most similarly-sized spelljammers would dare carry, but safe enough for short journeys. Drakkars powered by major or minor helms usually carry 1-2 priests of the Norse pantheon who will serve as helmsmen, however the rest of the crew will be made up entirely of experienced warriors. Drakkars powered by Oars of the Void will often have crews with no spellcasters at all.
    Ship Uses:
    Raider: The vast majority of Drakkars are used as raiding vessels. These ships usually specialize in making surprise attacks on small settlements, and are involved in few ship-to-ship battles. Since they usually carry a large number of warriors, Drakkars are rarely attacked by pirates despite their poor handling. Likewise, they rarely attack other ships since their poor maneuverability makes it difficult for them to close with an enemy ship, while they lack sufficient large weapons to effectively fight a ranged battle. Drakkars powered by Oars of the Void, however, can be the exception to this rule. Such Drakkars often carry a full 8 sets of Oars, providing an impressive SR 8. This speed is often enough for the Drakkar to get close enough to grapple with an enemy ship despite its poor maneuverability. Drakkar raiders usually raid over short distances only, usually attacking targets less than a week away.
    Trader: A very small number of Drakkars are used as legitimate traders. Typically this is only done by those with a cultural bias towards using viking ships, since the Drakkar has little to recommend it as a trade vessel.
    Other Configurations:
    Whaler: Some Drakkars have been modified to serve as Whalers, hunting kindori for the wealth that can be extracted from their carcasses. The only modification that these vessels typically have is the replacement of the heavy weapon with 4 light ballistas which have been modified to fire harpoons.

    Summary: |
    The Dreadnought is a spelljamming ship built and used by illithids .
    Description: |
    The newest and largest ship in the illithid fleets, the Dreadnought represents the full exploitation of the pool helm's ability to move ships larger than 50 tons. The Dreadnought looks like a great snail shell laid on its side, resting on two hulls. The hulls are similar to the forward section of a standard Nautiloid . One of the hulls is known as the command hull, and contains the officers' quarters, while the other is the battle hull, and is used for ramming (although the command hull could also be used for ramming if needed). Both hulls mount catapults for assaults. The interior of the shell is a single great vault, similar to the interior of a Nautiloid. Walkways around the perimeter provide access to the ballista stations and the various officers' posts. The vault is lit with red hues and dominated by the glowing pool that provides the motive force for spelljamming. The captain's post is on a catwalk over the pool.
    Crew: |
    One mind flayer is deadly. Twenty-five of them, the typical number found on a Dreadnought, are a disaster waiting to happen. Fewer illithids are not uncommon, but more are virtually unheard of. The leaders aboard ship consist of the captain and four staff officers. The duties of these staff officers are interchangeable. Each staff officer maintains his own group of supporters amongst the other mind flayers on the ship. Wise captains play one side off another to retain control of the ship in the face of ambitious staff officers. Despite this political intrigue aboard the Dreadnought, no officer would put the ship at risk merely to advance his own career (at least, not if he could get caught doing it). The remainder of the crew consists of slaves. The bulk of the slaves are humans , dwarves , elves , and other races captured from enemy ships and impressed into service. In addition, each officer and the captain maintains a personal slave who is treated much as a loyal pet. These personal servants, whose loyalty is ensured psionically, are counted on to pass on any information they get from the other slaves pertaining to the ship's political climate.
    Ship Uses:
    Diplomacy: Dreadnoughts have only appeared very recently, and have so far been primarily used in large-scale mind flayer activity, in particular in cases where the illithids want to drive a particular point home. Usually in such "diplomatic" missions, the Dreadnought will be escorted by 2-4 Nautiloids.
    Exploration: Lone Dreadnoughts are beginning to be used as exploration craft, particularly in areas known to have active spelljamming races. A large, powerful ship, manned by mind flayers, tends to make a strong impression on newcomers to the spelljamming community. Illithids have used these impressive ships to open up very favourable trade agreements with several organizations already.
    Other Configurations:
    Pirate Dreadnought: The first Dreadnoughts encountered in many spheres have not been actual representatives of the illithids, but various rogues, outlaws, and pirates who can use a great ship in their raids. It seems that these ships were not actually captured from the mind flayers, but rather the various shipyards building Dreadnoughts had no problem "losing" a ship or two, which then found its way into other hands. Pirate Dreadnoughts are powered by major helms, and are typically stripped to make them more maneuverable (MC raises to D, while AR drops to 6). They also tend to have additional breaches in the main shell, behind which are mounted up to 6 light ballistas.
    Heavy Dreadnought: This experimental version has its hull both thickened and plated, giving the ship an impressive AR 2, but reducing MC to F. The clumsy ship also boasts significantly upgraded weaponry, carrying 4 heavy catapults and 8 heavy ballistas. The cargo capacity of this dangerous vessel is reduced to a mere 12 tons, making it a short-range combat vessel. The Heavy Dreadnought is intended as a defensive craft for the most important illithid bases. In such a role, the Heavy Dreadnought would be badly out-maneuvered by most attackers, and would have to be supported by several Nautiloids in order to make it effective, with the smaller craft herding attackers towards the Heavy Dreadnought. The practicality of this ship has yet to be tested in combat.

    Summary: |
    The Dromond is a spelljamming ship built and used by groundling humans .
    Description: |
    A large groundling galley, the Dromond is long and slender, and has better handling in space than most groundling ships. Despite this, the Dromond is fragile, and leaves much to be desired. Relatively heavily armed for a ship in its size, the Dromond's weaponry is meant more to discourage attack than to actually be used in combat. Dromonds tend to be quick to surrender in combat situations, unless faced with situations in which being taken alive is a worse fate than death, such as attacks from neogi .
    Crew: |
    When used as a sea-going vessel, a Dromond typically has a crew of about 200 men, and can carry as many as 100 warriors. If this many were carried into space, they would quickly suffocate. Instead, a space-going Dromond usually carries about 20 men, which is much safer, and makes the Dromond capable of journeys lasting several months. Dromonds powered by Oars of the Void may carry more crew if they are using more than the minimum number of Oars, but this is only common if the Dromond is being used as a short-range troop transport.
    Ship Uses:
    Trader: For a groundling vessel, the Dromond makes a relatively good trading ship in space. Able to carry an average amount of cargo for its size, and requiring a relatively small crew for a groundling ship in general, and a galley in particular. Despite this, a Dromond trader will typically only operate in safe areas of space, since it is vulnerable to pirates.
    Troop Transport: Over short distances, Dromonds make good troop transports, being able to accommodate as many as 300 men. Since these ships can easily break up in the face of enemy fire, which would result in a great loss of life, Dromonds used in this fashion usually mount a full 16 pairs of Oars of the Void, allowing them to achieve SR 8 and outrun most potential attackers, reaching their destination intact.
    Other Configurations:
    War Dromond: Some Dromonds are modified to be heavily-armed warships. These ships feature raised castles fore and aft to serve as firing platforms, hulls that have been thickened and armour plated, a sharp piercing_ram , and replace the weaponry with a pair of greek_fire_projectors in the forecastle and a single heavy catapult in the aft castle. The net result is a vessel with MC F, AR 7, and a mere 3 tons of cargo space. It should be noted that this is not a modification typically performed by spacefarers, and instead represents the groundling warship variant of the Dromond. Spacefarers will typically purchase a more suitable warship rather than modify the Dromond to serve in combat. Despite this, a War Dromond makes an effective short-range defense craft used by many groundling nations to protect themselves from space-borne attackers, especially since for such short-range defense it usually carries a full groundling crew, which is capable of overwhelming the marines of all but the largest of attacking ships. War Dromonds operated in this manner by groundling nations tend to carry a full complement of Oars of the Void.

    Summary: |
    The Eel Ship is a spelljamming ship built and used by humans .
    Description: |
    An earlier, cruder version of the lamprey , these slim vessels were popular for planetary defense. Many of these ships are used by pirate raiders unable to get anything better, or to conduct stealthy hit and run missions for hire. The eel was one of the first ships designed specifically for spacefaring by humans, and was very popular in its day.
    Crew: |
    The usual fighting crew for ship of this type is 10-12 men, although it can sail with as few as 4. The ship is quite spartan, and as a result larger crews are rare even on short voyages. A typical crew will have few officers, usually just a captain, a first mate, and a spelljammer/navigator.
    Ship Uses:
    Raider: Primarily used as a short-range combat craft, the eel was popular amongst pirates and other raiders. This is a function which many eel ships still serve, primarily because the simple design of the craft means that almost any group, even under-funded pirates, can construct it, with only the most basic ship-building skills and tools. The weaponry of a raider eel frequently varies from the norm, based primarily on what is available.
    Defender: A more lawful use for the eel ship, and the one for which it was originally intended, is that of escorts and planetary defense ships. An escort will typically be equipped as described above, but a planetary defender will usually carry heavier weaponry, and will often be topped out. Planetary defenders so equipped will usually carry about 20 crew, but only for extremely short voyages, usually less than a day.
    Trader: Many eel ships once served as traders, before being supplanted by larger ships, such as the tradesman . Some few eel ships still serve in this purpose, usually in similar roles to the dragonfly .
    Other Configurations:
    Heavy Defender: This planetary defense version of the eel ship features a hull which has been thickened and plated, topped-out rigging, and armament consisting of 2 heavy ballistas , a light catapult , and a blunt_ram . The resulting ship has a minimum crew of 6, a total fighting crew of 15, is MC C and AR 4, but cargo space is non-existent, resulting in a ship which cannot afford to stray more than a few hours away from its home base.

    Summary: |
    The Flitter is a spelljamming ship built and used by elves .
    Description: |
    One of the smallest standard ships in space, the Flitter is also one of the most common. The small butterfly-like craft is grown, like many other elven ships, from the fruit of the starfly_plant . The process for growing living ships from this plant remains one of the most closely-guarded secrets of the elves. Like many other elven craft, Flitters continue to grow and must be maintained. This maintenance consists of periodic pruning to keep the craft from becoming overgrown and unwieldy (see the Wild Flitter listed below). While any serious damage to the fragile Flitter will destroy it (killing the ship in the process), minor damage will heal in time. This healing can be accelerated by grafting in pieces of wood.
    The "wings" of the Flitter are as flexible as the petals of a flower, unlike most other elven-grown ships, which typically have wings whose flexibility is more similar to that of a young sapling. This allows the wings to be furled up, so that other ships can carry Flitters in relatively compact spaces. This also provides the motive force for Flitters which lack spelljamming helms. A Flitter without a helm can travel at SR 2 by flapping its wings in a distinctive rippling motion (it is this motion which gives the Flitter its name). The movement of the wings is organic, and is impossible in a craft which has died, or which is overgrown (the wings of an overgrown craft become too brittle to withstand such motion). The living ship has been magically modified by the elves during growth to respond to pressure in certain areas within the body of the craft, such that a pilot need only apply pressure in the appropriate places to encourage the Flitter to fly. Of course, achieving spelljammer speeds without a helm is not possible, making a depowered Flitter useful only for short distance travel. The same mechanism is used to maneuver the ship even when it is powered by a spelljamming helm.
    Flitters that were grown before the first_Unhuman_War did not have the innovation of these organically-controlled wings, and instead had the somewhat more rigid wings common to other elven craft. See below for details of these archaic Flitters.
    The Flitter is designed to be handled by a single passenger/captain/helmsman who sits just ahead of the wings in the "head" of the ship. Given its small size and delicate construction, the Flitter is not recommended for long trips. Traveling in a Flitter has been compared to riding a tireless horse for several days - you get where you're going, but not very comfortably. The flitter has insufficient interior space for any significant cargo, and will typically only carry the personal gear of the pilot, along with food and water. The ship is not designed to carry any large weapons, and cannot be easily modified for that purpose.
    Crew: |
    As discussed above, a Flitter typically carries only a single individual. For short-range purposes, however, a Flitter will often carry one or more passengers in addition to the pilot. This is usually only done for trips that are expected to last for a few hours at most.
    Flitters used as fighters will usually carry a pilot and a single passenger who will either be an expert with a longbow, or a mage. The passenger serves as the Flitter's weaponry.
    Ship Uses:
    Messenger: When equipped with a spelljamming helm, a Flitter is best at carrying very light goods over short-to-mid-range interstellar distances. Since the lightest good to carry is information, Flitters with spelljamming helms most often serve as messengers between elven ships and bases. These missions can be dangerous for the messengers, called "lone riders" in the elven tongue.
    Scout: The scout is the next most common usage of Flitters equipped with spelljamming helms. The Flitter's small size makes it an excellent reconnaissance and espionage ship, capable of slipping into small areas and making planetfall.
    Landing Craft: Many Flitters are carried by larger elven ships and used as landing craft. These Flitters are depowered, as described above. In this configuration, the Flitter is useless for long voyages, but suitable for short hops into and out of an atmosphere, or between ships. This is in keeping with the standard policy of the Imperial Elven Navy which does not allow ships equipped with spelljamming helms to make planetfall.
    Small Fighters: A large number of Flitters, perhaps the majority, are used as small fighter-craft. These ships are depowered, and are carried by larger elven vessels, especially Armadas and Men-o-War . In this use, the Flitters are intended to soften up the enemy before the main attack, by peppering the target with arrows and spells.
    Other Configurations:
    Archaic Flitters: As mentioned above, archaic Flitters grown before the first Unhuman War used more rigid wings than those of modern Flitters. These Flitters could not have their wings furled in the manner of modern Flitters, with the result that far fewer Flitters could be carried by a mother ship, since a single archaic Flitter takes up a great deal of storage space. Prior to the invention of the modern Flitter, each elven ship would typically carry only between one and five Flitters. The lack of flexible, organically-controlled wings also meant that archaic Flitters could not fly under their own power. Most archaic Flitters were powered by full-blown spelljamming helms, or by an engine powered by a combustible variety of sap. Such engines provided the ancient Flitters with SR 1, and could only power the ship for a maximum of 2 hours before the ship would run out of sap for fuel (assuming that all of the ship's meager cargo space is filled with the sap). Archaic Flitters equipped with these engines were vulnerable to fire in the same manner as a ship carrying a greek_fire_projector . For obvious reasons, the engines of these archaic Flitters were less than ideal, and the improvements in the design of the modern Flitter are seen as one of the reasons why the elves won the first Unhuman War. Since the natural lifespan of a Flitter can easily exceed a millennium, a few archaic Flitters can still be found in space, although most have been destroyed over the centuries. The few archaic Flitters still used by the Imperial Elven Navy are equipped with spelljamming helms and used as messengers or scouts, tasks which they perform as well as any modern Flitter.
    Wild Flitters: It is not uncommon to encounter an abandoned Flitter drifting in virtually any area of wildspace or the_flow . These ships are usually the result of failed missions, undelivered messages, and old battles. Without regular maintenance, these ships are seriously overgrown, their wings curled in on themselves like seashells. Such ships may have workable engines within, and are MC E and AR 9 until properly trimmed back (repair costs equivalent to refitting half the hull). A wild, overgrown Flitter must be trimmed back before it can be flown without a helm.
    Firewinds: This type of depowered Flitter has not been used since the First Unhuman War, although with the advent of the Second Unhuman War the Admiralty is considering using it once more. The Firewind is a suicide craft, loaded with flammables and piloted to crash on enemy decks. Each Firewind used in this manner has the effect of two hits from a greek fire projector, in addition to normal crash damage. The pilots are trained to bail out before impact, and are given a method to escape if possible (a potion of flying , a dimension door spell, a gadabout , etc). Near the end of the First Unhuman War, the elves used charmed goblinkin as pilots. Most Firewinds were Flitters of the archaic variety, which were already obsolete at the time, and were usually packed to the gills with combustible sap already. In fact, the practice arose after several accidents with the obsolete Flitters, which caused impressive amounts of damage.

    Summary: |
    The Flying Pyramid is a spelljamming ship built by humans and used by the undead .
    Description: |
    A favorite spacebar tale is the ship-raiding of the Dark_Pharaoh , an undead mummy of great powers who preys upon the living to gain more undead servitors. The Pharaoh is said to plan a kingdom of undeath in the stars, and seeks to bring more ships under his sway, as well as priests of Set to serve him as agents amongst the living. So much is believable, but most scoff when they hear that the Pharaoh's ship is said to be a stone pyramid. Wiser spacefarers know that the tale is no myth, and that the flying pyramid was once a common ship in space . All flying pyramids are ancient ships, constructed by a now-vanished human culture which followed the Egyptian pantheon. Some of these ships were built as temples, but most were intended as grand funerary barges which would take a pharaoh or a high priest to the afterlife, waited on by a host of servants who volunteered to follow their master into death. The living servants would ritualistically kill themselves by manning the ship's helm one by one while travelling deep into the_phlogiston . By the time all of the servants were dead, the flying pyramid would be drifting far from known spacelanes, where the pharaoh or high priest could enjoy eternity without having to worry about graverobbers. At least, that was the idea. Many of those buried in these grand tombs became undead (typically mummies of some variety, but wights and priestly liches have also been encountered), usually animating their dead servants so that they could continue to serve. Without any living creatures to serve as fuel, these ships drifted until found by unlucky spacefarers, at which point the undead would attack the living, capturing enough of the living to take the ship back to spacelanes where the pyramid could continue to capture more fuel. It should be noted that not all of these funerary barges became host to the undead, as a few have been encountered drifting with none aboard but the truly dead. These few ships have been veritable treasure troves.
    Crew: |
    The crew sizes given are based on M-sized air-breathing creatures. Undead crews usually began as crews of approximately 90, but such a crew tends to grow after each successful raid. A practical maximum for an undead crew is about 360, but some flying pyramids can be found with even more lesser undead than this, often with many hanging on to the outside of the pyramid, waiting for a ship to get close enough for them to leap onto its deck. The common crewmen of an undead ship are usually skeletons, but other possibilities include heucuva, crypt servants, or low-powered mummies.
    Ship Uses:
    Undead Raider: Most flying pyramids rove through space as raiders, seeking both to increase the wealth of their masters, and to increase the size of their undead crews. The unusual appearance of these very rare ships, combined with the fact that when crewed by undead they tend to appear as derelicts, often entices curious spacers to investigate, allowing the concealed weapons of the pyramid to attack with surprise. Most undead raiders will lurk amongst asteroids and space debris, motionless as if derelict. Some undead intentionally allow mosses to grow on the exterior of the ship (which incidentally helps to keep the ancient stonework from falling apart), and allow debris to accumulate on the ship to enhance the appearance of abandonment. Undead crews will often cannibalize the insides of their vessels to load jettisons , sometimes even to the point of causing the ship to collapse into a field of debris.
    Defense Bases: Salvaged pyramids are typically used as defensive ships, orbiting space bases or protecting worlds. These ships are often armed with a combination of ballistas , catapults , and greek_fire_projectors . Pyramids used in this capacity are little more than semi-mobile weapon platforms.
    Command Ship: Not all salvaged pyramids are used as defense bases. Some have been purchased by navies for use as heavily protected, but clumsy, command ships. These ships will typically travel with a small fleet of lesser craft, and the flat surface of the underside will usually serve as a landing pad for small craft such as blades , flitters , or wreckboats .
    Other Configurations:
    The flying pyramid is too rare a ship, and too difficult to modify, to see any other significant variations.

    Summary: |
    The Galleon is a spelljamming ship built and used by groundling humans .
    Description: |
    Not designed for use in space , the Galleon is the best of the craft used by groundlings who first discover space travel and acquire a spelljamming helm. While more suitable for space travel than other groundling ships, the Galleon suffers from some of the same drawbacks as most groundling ships taken into space, but to a lesser extent. The Galleon has poor maneuverability and armour, although it can comfortably carry more than enough men to fully crew it while in space, and it carries what is generally considered to be adequate weaponry.
    Crew: |
    When used as a spelljamming vessel, the number of crew required to operate the Galleon is significantly lower than the crew required to operate it as a sailing ship. Whereas a seafaring Galleon will usually have a crew of about 130 men, and may even carry as many as 500 men including passengers, a Galleon which carries this number of men into space will quickly foul its air envelope. Most spelljamming Galleons carry a full crew of 30 men, sufficient to handle the ship and its weaponry, while allowing some spare crew to help out as needed.
    Ship Uses:
    Trader: Galleons make adequate trading vessels in space, and are the ships of choice for many of the more thoughtful groundling nations which dabble in spelljamming. While the Galleon does not perform as well in space as ships specifically designed for spelljamming, it is nevertheless an adequate ship, and has the advantage that it can easily trade with groundling nations without attracting much attention. The cargo holds of the Galleon are large enough that the ship can carry a significant amount of trade goods to and from foreign worlds. Most Galleons in space remain on well-travelled trade routes within a single sphere , where their chances of running into trouble are relatively low.
    Explorer: Some groundling nations use a handful of Galleons as exploration vessels. These ships will generally be royally chartered, and are expected to explore and bring back wonders and riches from the cosmos, as well as tales that will enhance the prestige of the royal house. Because each Galleon represents a significant investment, and its safe return is so important, the ship will usually be manned by the best and brightest heroes that the country can gather together. As a result, pirates attacking a royal explorer often find that once they attempt to board the ship, they are badly outclassed by the Galleon's crew.
    Other Configurations:
    Gunship: Some of the more technologically advanced groundling nations prefer this version of the Galleon, which they use primarily as a vessel of war. In this configuration the ballistas and catapult are stripped out. In their place the Gunship mounts an impressive 10 bombards , two in the forecastle (one is able to fire forward or to port, while the other can fire forward or to starboard), two in the stern castle (one able to fire aft or to port, and the other able to fire aft or to starboard), and six on the main deck (three facing port, and three facing starboard). Cargo space on the Gunship shrinks to a mere 5 tons. These ships require a full 50 men to operate the ship and her weaponry at peak efficiency, but usually carry about twice that. Gunship Galleons are short-range craft, but are feared in the spheres in which they are known, since they can deliver a truly devastating broadside. The giff are particularly impressed by this configuration of the Galleon. The Gunship Galleon design has led to the recent development of the Clipper vessel by an advanced groundling culture using giff mercenaries.

    Summary: |
    The Great Bombard is a spelljamming ship built and used by giff .
    Description: |
    One of the few ships designed for the giff (the design was actually made by a human shipwright hired by a group of giff, but the plans have spread to several different giff organizations which have built a number of the craft), the Great Bombard resembles a single-decked groundling bireme, and indeed such a craft actually served as the frame for the first of these ships. The rowing banks are planked over, and the prow is removed and replaced with a huge bombard of cold iron banded with steel rings, which runs half the length of the ship. The bombard is also typically capped with a great brass blunt ram, which is usually ornately sculpted, often in the shape of a giff's head. Great Bombards carry pre-measured tin drums, each of which carries the 20 charges of smoke powder needed to fire a single shot from the great bombard. Any critical hit against a Great Bombard has a 10% chance of igniting the powder stores, inflicting 3d10 x 5 hull points of damage (this is greater than normal because, in addition to the prodigious amounts of smokepowder carried for the main gun, the giff crew will usually be carrying considerable additional powder for their personal weapons).
    Although the design is based on a groundling ship, the Great Bombard is badly unbalanced by its main weapon, and when landing in water it will tend to capsize in all but the most calm of waters. As a result, Great Bombards usually dock only at asteroid bases, and stay away from large worlds .
    Crew: |
    The crew numbers given above are for human-sized crew. Since the Great Bombard was actually designed for use by the giff, it can be handled by only 10 of the large, powerful creatures. The four chief officers aboard a Great Bombard are the respected captain, the noble helmsman, the puissant crafter, and the master gunsman. The master gunsman is responsible for firing the bombard. The puissant crafter is responsible for maintenance of the weapon. The noble helmsman does not actually man the helm (since giff are unable to cast spells, and are thus unable to power standard helms), but instead is in charge of the hired human or other individual operating the helm. The respected captain, of course, gives the order to fire. The remaining giff on board (typically a total of 20 giff are carried) are assistants to the ship's masters, as well as being responsible for the ship's maneuverability, keeping the gun clean, reloading the gun, forming boarding parties, and manning the light ballistas when necessary (although these are considered sissy weapons). The respected captain is the ultimate leader of the giff, but he will almost always be acting on the orders of whomever has hired the giff as mercenaries.
    Ship Uses:
    Mercenary Warship: Virtually all of the two dozen or so Great Bombards which are known to exist serve as mercenary warships, hiring out their services to the highest bidder. The Great Bombard is the giff super-weapon - a mobile platform with a big gun on it, capable of knocking most of its opponents into the next crystal_sphere . As the ship is dominated by its gun, so too the captain and crew are dominated by their need to acquire enough smokepowder to fire the great bombard. As a result, Great Bombards must be continually employed as mercenaries in order to afford the huge weapon's ammunition. Great Bombards are usually hired by factions with small or non-existent fleets of their own, as they are often used as intimidation weapons more than anything else. In large fleet actions, the Great Bombard is almost as great a danger to friends as it is to foes. The Great Bombards in known space form a loose brotherhood of giff known as the Cult of the Gun. All captains are members by the very act of possessing the Great Bombard, and one captain will never fire upon another for fear of damaging the weapon.
    Other Configurations:
    Gunship: When possible, and when sufficient smokepowder is available, the giff will replace the light ballistas with typical bombards, mounted on turrets. The giff greatly prefer this version to the standard configuration, but it tends to be impractical due to the scarcity of smokepowder.

    Summary: |
    The Great Galley is a spelljamming ship built and used by groundling humans .
    Description: |
    An improved version of the Dromond , the Great Galley is a groundling vessel intended to serve as a fast trader and warship in coastal waters. On the seas, with its 140 oars and 3 sails, a Great Galley outclasses a Dromond, but it adapts very poorly to space . The Great Galley handles so poorly in space that it suffers a -1 penalty to SR in addition to having MC F. In an attempt to make up for these severe shortcomings, the Dromond carries very heavy weaponry for a ship its size; however, this is often not enough to deter potential attackers, especially if such attackers are able to stay out of range of the weapons and attack the Great Galley from a distance. Most spacefarers using a Great Galley will attempt to acquire a more suitable vessel as soon as possible.
    Crew: |
    On the water a Great Galley will typically carry a crew of 150 men, 140 of whom are rowers and 10 of whom are sailors. In addition, if serving as a warship, the Great Galley may carry as many as 150 soldiers. Needless to say, taking such a large crew into space would be suicidal for all but the shortest of journeys. Instead, a Great Galley in space will typically carry about 40 men, which still limits the length of journeys the craft can undertake, but not to the same degree as a full crew. Great Galleys powered by Oars of the Void will often carry larger crews in order to operate extra sets of Oars.
    Ship Uses:
    Experimental Vessel: Most Great Galleys found in space are there as a result of a groundling culture's first experiments with space travel. These ships are typically "testing the waters" so to speak, in order to determine if spelljamming is a good investment. If they survive long enough, these ships usually return with the recommendation that different ships be used for any future endeavors.
    Troop Transport: The next most common usage of Great Galleys in space is to serve as a short range troop transport. These ships are usually powered by Oars of the Void, and will be used to carry as many as 300 men on journeys that will usually last less than a week. When used in this manner, it is highly desirable for the Great Galley to be escorted in order to avoid having it destroyed by an enemy before it delivers its troops.
    Trader: A very small number of Great Galleys are used as trading vessels in the safer areas of space. Usually the owners of such ships are attempting to make enough money to purchase a better ship.
    Other Configurations:
    War Galley: A War Galley is a Great Galley which has had its hull thickened and reinforced, mounts a piercing_ram , and carries a greek_fire_projector in addition to its normal weaponry. The AR is improved to 6, but the cargo space drops to only 3 tons. Like the similar modification found on the War Dromond, this is actually a modification intended for use on the seas, and it will usually only be seen in space when used as a short range defense craft by groundling nations. Such ships will carry their full groundling crew, and will usually be powered by a full 16 pairs of Oars of the Void for maximum speed. Like the War Dromonds, these craft are dangerous, but are limited to extremely short range use.

    Summary: |
    The Hammership is a spelljamming ship built by humans and lizard_men and used by various spacefaring races.
    Description: |
    Another standard human ship of space, the Hammership is large and powerful, capable of withstanding large amounts of punishment, and dealing out a significant amount with its blunt_ram and heavy weapons. If the Squid_Ship is the medium warship of space, this is the heavy galleon. Hammerships are found, with minor modifications to their design, throughout known space. The Hammership's design has been relatively unchanged, such that hulks hundreds of years old resemble those under construction in modern dry docks. Even the illithids and the elves , with their own distinctive ships, use the Hammership design for workhorse and supply situations.
    Crew: |
    The "brains" of the Hammership are in the heavily protected forward section. Both the helm and the bridge are located in this section, behind the massive bulwarks and the blunt ram. Often this area is plated with heavy metals, ivory, or bone to provide extra strength. The lenses of the Hammership's "eyes" are often made of paneless glass, but in some (more expensive) versions are constructed of glassteel. The captain usually operates from a base behind these windows, commanding both the ship and the forward weapons placements, while the first officer is usually stationed at the rear catapult .
    Ship Uses:
    Trading: A Hammership requires a larger crew than the more common Squid Ships or Tradesmen , but it can carry more cargo, and is a daunting vessel for a pirate to attack. This makes it ideal for carrying large bulk cargos. Such ships frequently run on a minimum crew, unless they are passing through a contested area of space, in which case the captain will usually take on a full crew, including whatever battle wizards and priests he can hire. Some mind flayers use Hammerships as free traders, unaligned to any illithid faction or house. This is particularly common in those areas of space where Nautiloids are frequently fired-upon on sight. The eyes of Hammerships controlled by mind flayers are usually covered over with steel plates.
    Piracy: Though not commonly used as a pirate vessel, the Hammership is the favorite craft of some of the most stylish and brazen pirates and privateers in known space, including the legendary Bloodjack of Realmspace . His Hammership is dyed in shades of red, supposedly representing the the blood he and his ship, the Lucky_Victory , have spilled over a career spanning a decade. The size of a Hammership makes it ideal for prolonged battles - just the sort of conflict Bloodjack seems to revel in. Most pirates and privateers, however, prefer smaller swifter ships which will allow them to board an enemy as quickly as possible, thus avoiding a long space battle.
    Military: The Hammership is a common armada craft, capable of hauling many men across space, and returning with supplies to support an invasion. For intra-sphere uses, such craft frequently carry up to 200 soldiers (including the crew), although this is obviously not possible for longer voyages unless magic is used to keep the air envelope fresh and the crew provisioned. Hammerships can be considered to be the standard heavy warship of most human nations.
    Elven Support Ship: Hammerships are sometimes used by the Imperial Elven Navy, primarily as supply and troop ships. The Hammership's bulk and heavy handling (compared to most elven craft) make it unsuitable for the elven style of space combat, relegating it to the role of support ship. Hammerships which the elves believe may see combat may be stripped, reducing AR to 8 but increasing MC to C. Topping out is not a popular option, since the elves prefer to operate their Hammerships with as few trained sailors as possible, instead sending such trained elves to the more important Men-o-War and Armadas which make up the main elven battle line. Troop ships, however, may be topped out.
    Other Configurations:
    Multiple Turrets: Some versions of the Hammership mount extra turrets for large weapons ( ballistas or catapults depending on the tastes of the owner). A typical configuration will include two extra turrets on the main deck. Some versions will remove the overhead hatch of the cargo hold in order to place a third turret, instead using newly-built side hatches for access to the cargo bay. This makes the ship leaky and dangerous to land on water. Such ships may even place one or more turrets on the underside of the ship, making a landing of any sort impossible. These heavily-armed vessels are typically only used by military forces for relatively short-range work, since they are extremely deadly, but cargo space drops dramatically (as well as operational flexibility for those no longer able to land safely).
    Lizard Man Vessels: Hammerships operated by lizard men will typically have the ship's central deck flooded to provide a relaxation area for the crew. This also serves as a fire-control mechanism for the ship, which will frequently see bombards used in place of the catapults, and a greek_fire_projector in place of the ballista. Unfortunately for the lizard men, this fire control mechanism is frequently unsuccessful, since any powder stores must be kept dry to remain useful, and if a spark ignites nearby, there is often not enough time to fetch water from the central deck before the stores explode.

    Summary: |
    The Hummingbird is a unique spelljamming ship built and used by humans .
    Description: |
    A unique vessel built by the Royal Engineers of Thesalys in Greatspace , the Hummingbird is intended as a royal yacht and court ship, often used for carrying dignitaries. The wings protruding from the craft have a purpose other than aesthetics. The magical energies of the spelljamming_helm are focused through these wings, causing them to vibrate rapidly. This is what gives the ship its impressive maneuverability, yet the vibration is so smooth, and the engineering of the ship so flawless that the vibrations have not noticeable effect to someone on board the Hummingbird .
    The ship's primary weapon is equally as impressive as its engineering. The long beak of the craft, as well as serving as a piercing_ram , houses a magical ship-to-ship combat weapon. In the forward part of the ship is a Magic Missile device. A wizard with the Magic Missile spell (or a user of a Wand of Magic Missiles ) may cast it into the large crystal mounted on the device (this is an exception to the general rule that Magic Missiles can only target creatures and not objects), and the spell will be absorbed, amplified, and launched from the tip of the ship's beak. A single missile may be launched each round, causing a number of hull points of damage equal to 1 HP per missile that was fired into the device. For example, a mage who casts a Magic Missile spell creating 5 missiles will be able to fire a single missile from the beak causing 5 HP of damage. Unlike the normal missiles fired by the Magic Missile spell, the amplified missiles do not hit unerringly, but rather have the same range and THAC0 as a light ballista . Magic Missiles cast into this device must be amplified and used immediately and cannot be stored for future use. Since only one missile may be fired each round, if multiple Magic Missile spells are cast into the device in the same round, only the highest level caster's spell will be accepted, and any others will be wasted.
    Crew: |
    The Hummingbird operates with a single captain and helmsman, requiring no other crew to keep it functioning at peak efficiency. In practice, however, the crew always consists of the captain and two helmsmen, allowing one wizard to always be at the helm, while another is available to cast spells into the Magic Missile device if needed. In addition to this crew, the Hummingbird will usually be carrying 1-4 dignitaries.
    Ship Uses:
    Court Ship: The Hummingbird is exclusively used by the royal family of Greatspace as a court ship, transporting dignitaries and taking small parties on pleasure cruises.
    Other Configurations:
    Since the Hummingbird is currently unique (there has been talk of building more of the craft to serve as private yachts for wealthy noble families), there are no other configurations.

    Summary: |
    The Hunter-Killer (or Vodoni Assassin ) is a spelljamming ship built by the Zalani and used by the Vodoni and humans .
    Description: |
    A less common ship than the Werewolf , the Hunter-Killer was intended to serve as a command vessel for Vodoni forces. Designed and built for the Vodoni by the enslaved Zalani, the Hunter-Killer appears as a twin-headed, smiling she-wolf with a huge wing-like swiveling sail. Because of the unusual design of the swiveling mast and sail, the Hunter-Killer cannot be effectively topped out, unless it is first given more conventional rigging in place of the swivel-mast (which would reduce MC to D and increase the minimum crew to 16 before any topping out).
    The weapons of the Hunter-Killer are specially designed to have double the range of more conventional weapons. The ballistas , catapults , and jettisons use an unknown substance which is similar to sinew, but much stronger, to create additional torsion for extra power. The bombards are ruggedly-built and use double the regular load of smokepowder for extra power. In addition to these refinements, all of the weapons use specially designed ammunition (double normal cost) to help gain extra range. In all cases the ammunition is designed to gain extra spin before leaving the air envelope of the Hunter-Killer, thus allowing greater accuracy over longer ranges. If normal ammunition is substituted, the weapons are reduced to standard ranges (although crew requirements are unchanged). The additional complexity of these weapons cause them to require double the normal crew in order to operate. In addition, crew with the weapon loader or appropriate large weapon proficiencies will be unable to gain the benefits of these proficiencies when using these weapons until they have spent 2-4 weeks training with them.
    Far fewer Hunter-Killers were captured during the fall of the Vodoni empire than Werewolves. This is partly because the ship was much less common than the Werewolf, and partly because those Hunter-Killers encountered were usually able to stay far enough away from their enemies to avoid capture. Most of those Hunter-Killers that were captured found their way into the hands of humans, for the same reasons that most captured Werewolves are now in the hands of humans.
    Crew: |
    A Hunter-Killer can be comfortably handled by a crew consisting of a captain, a spelljammer, and 8 sailors to work the swivel-mast. This efficiency in crewing is necessitated by the fact that fully 40 men are needed to man the ship's weapons. In the hands of Vodoni, the captain and spelljammer would be breeders (see the Werewolf for details), the rest of the crew and the weaponeers would be humans, and the ship would also carry 10 enforcers or, where possible, the more powerful conquerors to protect the ship from any enemy boarding parties. The breeders aboard a Hunter-Killer will usually be of high level, since the Hunter-Killer is usually a command ship. Human crews tend to be arranged along similar lines, and will employ Vodoni-trained weaponeers where possible.
    Ship Uses:
    Command Ship: The Hunter-Killer was intended to serve as a command ship, staying out of range of enemy weapons while coordinating other Vodoni ships and simultaneously pounding the enemy with its own weapons. As such, a Hunter-Killer would usually be found leading a small fleet of 1-4 Werewolves and often 1-2 Nightwolves . Those Hunter-Killers which have been captured are usually used in this manner as well, since it is a role to which the ship is very well suited.
    Reaver: Since the fall of the Vodoni empire, the Hunter-Killers which have remained in Vodoni hands have turned to raiding to survive. Unfortunately for their crews, keeping a Hunter-Killer equipped with the specialized ammunition it requires is virtually impossible without organized supply lines. As a result, most reaver Hunter-Killers now use more standard ammunition. This means that their weapons now function in the same manner as standard weapons, except that they require additional crew to operate. Because of this, along with the fact that any crew attrition aboard a Hunter-Killer can cause a severe decrease in fighting capacity, most reaver Hunter-Killers have had short careers. Some of these ships have surrendered, while others have simply vanished. It is believed that those which have vanished have likely fled to backwater worlds where the crews can eke out an existence for themselves.
    Other Configurations:
    Conventional Weapons: Those Hunter-Killers which are unable to continue to obtain specialized ammunition for their long-range weapons often replace these weapons with more conventional versions. Usually this will simply mean replacing the weapons individually with their conventional counterparts, but some ships, attempting to maintain the long-range combat ability of the Hunter-Killer, have been equipped with all light weapons. Such a ship will usually have 4 light catapults, 4 light ballistas, and 2 bombards .

    Summary: |
    The Klicklikak is a spelljamming ship built and used by the insectare .
    Description: |
    The Klicklikak is a distinctive, sleek-looking ship that resembles a grasshopper's head with two long antennae trailing behind it. The ship's name means "service to Klikral " in the insectare native tongue. The Klicklikak is powered by an insectare helm, a device which functions exactly as a standard_helm (it may be either major or minor), with the exception that it includes a shiny copper sphere with two holes in it through which the insectare insert their antennae. Only insectare can use these helms, and conversely (for reasons which remain unexplained), insectare cannot use other helm types.
    Crew: |
    A Klicklikak will carry at least 2 mages to serve as spelljammers. The captain is often a multi-classed fighter/mage, or fighter/wizard/thief. The remainder of the crew (which will typically number about 8-10) will usually be fighters or thieves. The exact organization of the crew is a closely-guarded secret, as with so many other aspects of insectare life.
    Ship Uses:
    Unknown: Klicklikaks are only very rarely encountered, and thus far none have been able to determine what missions they have been on. Insectare are much more often encountered hidden on the ships of other races, working behind the scenes on their schemes. It is unknown what might might incite the insectare to use their own ships outside of their hidden home sphere. Though adequately armed, all Klicklikaks so far encountered have endeavored to flee from any who have seen them.
    Other Configurations:
    No other configurations of the Klicklikak have been encountered; however, considering how few have ever been sighted, it is entirely possible that modified versions exist.

    Summary: |
    The Lamprey Ship is a spelljamming ship built and used by humans .
    Description: |
    This ancient ship was a development of the Eel_Ship , intended specifically as a fighting craft. The Lamprey is larger than the Eel, and mounts more weaponry. The cone ram functions as a piercing_ram with a few modifications. Once the Lamprey has successfully rammed another ship, the cone ram's 4 "jaw-grapples" can be tightened, causing an additional 1-2 hull points of damage and locking the ships together as a grappling_ram . If the jaw-grapples are not tightened, the design of the ram makes it impossible for the Lamprey to get stuck in the rammed ship, unlike a normal piercing ram. In addition, the cone is hollow, and mounts a modified medium ballista . This ballista can be fired into the rammed ship (if it is aimed at crew make a normal THAC0 roll, otherwise it will automatically hit and damage the ship) to great effect. This apparently-brilliant design does have some major drawbacks. The interior ballista and its crew are exposed to attack and debris damage (in a ramming attack each crewman must save vs. poison or be knocked cold for 1d4 rounds by debris from the impact). Despite the reinforcement of the hollow bow, its very design makes it more fragile than a normal ram, so that the ship suffers 1-2 hull points of damage each time a successful ram attack is made. This cannot be countered by adding extra armour and reinforcement, since this area is already reinforced as much as possible. More importantly, the ballista's firing "mouth" and access tunnel create a funnel that can send fiery attacks into the ship's interior. In fact, a lucky ballista bolt into the cone ram has a very good chance of traveling straight into the helm after skewering the crew of the cone ballista.
    Crew: |
    The usual fighting crew of a Lamprey was 16. Although the ship is capable of supporting larger crews, like the Eel, the Lamprey is a relatively spartan and uncomfortable ship, so larger crews are not common.
    Ship Uses:
    Raider: In this role the Lamprey is usually unmodified. The Lamprey was best heavy combat craft of its day, and still packs enough of a punch to be a popular attack ship in its size class. The crew of a raider Lamprey is usually a full 23, despite the uncomfortable living quarters. This allows a squad of boarding troops to be carried. In addition to the more common human crews of these ships, a number have been seized by orcs and hobgoblins who use the ship in this role. In fact, it is suspected that there is a hidden hobgoblin shipyard somewhere producing these ships; however, this is unproven.
    Other Configurations:
    War Boat: This version of the Lamprey replaces the controversial cone ram and ballista with either a blunt or piercing ram, and mounts a turretted medium catapult on the underside. Cargo space in this configuration drops to 3 tons, making it suitable only for relatively short range uses, however the replacement of the cone ram allows war boat Lampreys to land on water without sinking.
    Fastboat: This variety replaces the ram with a piercing ram (allowing it to land on water), and drops all other armament aside from a single ballista. The ship is stripped to raise maneuverability class to A, although AR is reduced to 6, while the ship is now able to carry 10 tons of cargo. This version usually serves as a fast shuttle in dangerous areas of space.
    Shuttle: This "runner" Lamprey is commonly seen making runs between worlds in the same sphere. The cone-ram is replaced with a simple up-swept bow, and outrigger pontoons are added, giving the ship good stability for water landings. Only one medium ballista is retained, increasing cargo space to 12 tons.

    Summary: |
    The Lanceship is a spelljamming ship built by humans and used by various spacefaring races.
    Description: |
    The Lanceship is a fully-enclosed Calidian design intended as a multi-purpose craft. It strongly resembles its namesake, especially at a distance. Maneuvering is accomplished through the use of a sail rudder which can be manipulated by a single sailor from within the ship. If attacked, only crew manning the ballista turret are exposed. Lanceships have not been seen outside the Astromundi Cluster.
    Crew: |
    The Lanceship is very easy to operate, requiring only a minimal crew. While only two crewmen are required, a typical crew will number about 5-8 men, which allows enough crew to man the ballista, as well as providing a small party for ship defense.
    Ship Uses:
    Smuggler: The Lanceship has become infamous as a smuggling ship, since its size and maneuverability make it a logical choice for threading through an asteroid field and avoiding notice. For this reason, Lanceship crews in port are often closely watched by the authorities.
    Scout: The same qualities that make the Lanceship suitable as a smuggling ship make it ideal for small scouting parties over both long and short ranges.
    Adventurer's Ship: Lanceships are ideal for small adventuring parties, since they are easily operated without a large number of hirelings.
    Military: Although its light construction means that it cannot stand up to much punishment, the Lanceship makes a good light support craft, especially when carrying an elite boarding party.
    Other Configurations:
    Heavy Lance: A military version of the Lanceship, the Heavy Lance has its hull rebuilt out of metal, granting it AR 4 and 18 HP, although MC is reduced to C. Usually the ballista is replaced with a greek_fire_projector . The Heavy Lance is used to ram enemy ships, unleashing a squad of marines after first raking the deck with greek fire. Unlike the standard Lanceship, the Heavy Lance is much more likely to survive long enough to successfully perform such an attack.

    As its name implies, the thri-kreen Leaf-ship resembles a long leaf. There are stations around the hull at which up to four Thorn-ships can be docked. The vessels are grown from living crystal in a manner known only to the thri-kreen. The colour of these resilient ships is usually a delicate translucent green or yellow. Leaf-ships use a power source called a crystal throne, which is grown as an integral part of the ship at the same time that the ship itself is grown. Crystal thrones can only be used by thri-kreen, since all other races lack the correct mental architecture. Any thri-kreen can use the throne, regardless of any spell casting or psionic ability. While any individual thri-kreen can use a crystal throne for a maximum of 12 hours before requiring a full night's rest, there are no spelljamming after-effects. The SR of a ship powered by a crystal throne is based on the design of the ship itself, and not the abilities of the thri-kreen (although a helmsman with the spelljamming proficiency and a good THAC0 for the ram is preferred). The design of the Leaf-ship has been unchanged since it first appeared thousands of years ago. This can be explained largely by the thri-kreen's unusual concept of time as a fixed and immutable thing, which has led to strange and contradictory beliefs regarding technological progress. These beliefs are incomprehensible to all but the thri-kreen.
    At the height of the thri-kreen empire in space some 4,000 years ago, the Leaf-ship was extremely common. When the thri-kreen's religious crusade brought them into conflict with most other races in space, Leaf-ships began to be attacked on sight, and hundreds (if not thousands) of the ships were destroyed. In the intervening millennia thri-kreen religious beliefs have changed many times, such that in modern times Leaf-ships are seen by most spacefarers as being simply enigmatic vessels to be treated cautiously, rather than aggressive ships to be attacked. The fall of the thri-kreen empire, however, also led to many thri-kreen colonies being lost. These colonies reverted to relative barbarism, and relatively few colonies remained which retained the secrets of spelljamming, and of growing new Leaf-ships. It is believed that roughly half of the Leaf-ships that ply the spacelanes today are survivors of the ancient empire which have had many generations of crews, while the other half are new ships that have been grown in the intervening years.
    Crew: |
    Thri-kreen crews tend to see themselves as religious pilgrims, and will be organized as such regardless of the current mission of their Leaf-ship. These crews will almost always number 44 thri-kreen, since this provides enough crew to operate the vessel and its weaponry, as well as provide 3 crew for each Thorn-ship carried. Since the 4 Thorn-ships increase the size of their parent's air envelope while carried, a crew this size will not strain the air. Crews of other races are virtually unheard of due to the nature of the ship's propulsion. Those extremely rare non-kreen crews will invariably use an alternate power source, and could be organized in virtually any manner.
    Ship Uses:
    Workhorse: Leaf-ships serve as the workhorse for thri-kreen in space. They maintain contact between the spacefaring colonies, explore in an attempt to re-discover lost colonies, trade as needed to support other endeavors, defend thri-kreen interests, and work to spread their religious beliefs amongst thri-kreen (the frequently changing nature of thri-kreen religion leads to large numbers of missionary expeditions to spread new ideas to other thri-kreen) and non-kreen alike. The function of any given Leaf-ship may change at any time, making it virtually impossible for other spacefarers to tell how a given Leaf-ship is being used.
    Other Configurations:
    Thri-kreen modify their vessels only under extreme circumstances, and as a result there are no other significant configurations for the Leaf-ship.

    Summary: |
    The Libraria is a unique spelljamming ship built and used by Quentin_Axan .
    Description: |
    The Libraria is a unique ship built by the human mage Quentin Axan from the remnants of his crashed Tradesman . When Quentin's Tradesman crashed, he discovered a mysterious stone idol, whose sole purpose was the consumption of knowledge. The idol had impressive magical powers, and so Quentin used it to repair his major_helm , linking the helm to the idol in the process. The idol now functions exactly as a major helm, except that it can attain greater maneuverability classes through offerings of knowledge burned in its mouth, primarily paper and books. Normal, non-magical books and scrolls increase the MC to D for 1 round per book or scroll fed into the idol. Every clerical or magical scroll fed into the maw of the idol increases MC to C for four rounds, regardless of the number or level of spells inscribed upon it. A spell book fed into the idol increases MC to B for 6 rounds, while a magical book (such as a Libram of Silver Magic , or a Manual of Golems ) will increase the MC to A for 10 rounds. The idol is a harsh master, and is constantly roaring, demanding to be fed. Failure to feed the idol results in louder and louder imploring, and eventually the idol will begin to belch forth billows of poisonous gas, causing the atmosphere to become tainted in 5 rounds, forcing all aboard to save vs. poison each round or perish. In addition, the idol has the power to cast Flaming Sphere once per turn, but cannot use its spelljamming abilities to do so. This power is typically used as a defense when on the ground. It should be noted that the idol is capable of preventing the flames roaring in its mouth and eyes from escaping from these hollows, thus allowing the Libraria to safely enter the_phlogiston (although the flames seem alarmingly violent and bright within the idol's mouth and eyes while in the flow).
    Crew: |
    The Libraria is crewed entirely by Quentin Axan (N hm M9) and his assistants, four halfling priests who take turns as helmsmen, and spend the rest of their time cataloguing, copying, and reorganizing the countless books and scrolls on board, as well as feeding the idol regularly. Quentin will occasionally carry passengers, though always at the price of magical texts. Scribes may be allowed to work their passage by creating texts to be consumed while they sail.
    Ship Uses:
    Quentin, who had been obsessed with the acquisition of knowledge even before finding the idol, uses the Libraria to seek out libraries on forgotten or exotic worlds in order to gain more texts, particularly those of a magical nature. In his researches, Quentin has become convinced that the_Spelljammer houses libraries beyond compare, and he has become obsessed with finding the great ship. Quentin also theorizes that the Spelljammer may be powered in a similar way to the Libraria , and he hopes to be able to find a way to use his idol to gain control of the ship.
    Other Configurations:
    The Libraria is unique.

    Summary: |
    The Locust is a spelljamming ship built and used by the humans of Wa .
    Description: |
    These ships look like locusts made of balsa wood. They are very light and maneuverable, but easily destroyed. The small craft has enough room for its two crew members, as well as either a single passenger, or 1/4 ton of cargo. Any overloading beyond this will stress the light vessel's frame too much, and it will break up. Likewise, the light frame means that any hit will usually completely destroy a Locust (even a well-placed hit from a sheaf arrow can cause sufficient damage for the Locust to snap in half), but because the ship is so fast and maneuverable, it can be very difficult to hit. The single weapon uses the legs and antennae as supports. On a natural attack roll of 1, the weapon breaks off the ship, splintering the Locust in half. This usually kills the crew. Locusts are never equipped with spelljamming_helms , not even boat helms, and instead are powered by Rudders of Propulsion which allow the craft to achieve high tactical speeds, but which are not capable of spelljamming velocities.
    Crew: |
    The helmsman of a Locust sits in the aft, manning the Rudder of Propulsion , while the gunner sits in the front. The cargo, typically ballista shot or rocks for the catapult , lies in the midsection. If a passenger is carried this ammunition must be removed, and the weapon can carry only a single shot. If a Locust is carrying greek fire in place of ammunition, there will only be a single pilot on board.
    Ship Uses:
    Fighter: These craft are carried in large numbers by the huge Tsunamis that Wa operates. When the Tsunami crew sights and enemy, waves of Locusts are unleashed to weaken, or even completely destroy the ship, while the Tsunami lies back, lobbing its own attacks from a safe distance.
    Kamikaze: In particularly important battles, many Locusts may be loaded with greek fire. These ships, piloted by a single volunteer, simply crash into enemy vessels, exploding on impact. This attack causes 3d4 HP of damage to the ship struck, as well as 6d10 hp of damage to all within a 20' radius. This damage is partly because of the actual fiery explosion, but also partly because the Locust's construction means that when it explodes long sharp splinters of wood fly in all directions at dangerous velocities.
    Other Configurations:
    The tiny Locust is very ill-suited to modifications, since its light frame cannot stand up to such work.

    Summary: |
    The Longship is a spelljamming ship built and used by groundling humans .
    Description: |
    The standard ship of groundling viking cultures, the Longship is the ship which the larger Drakkar is based upon. The Longship is more maneuverable in space than many groundling ships, but is still clumsy for its size. Since these ships were designed to be powered by oars on water, and since they require large crews for their size in any case, Oars of the Void are a popular method for powering them in space.
    Crew: |
    When used on water, a Longship typically carries a crew of 40-50 men, plus 120-150 warriors. If such a large crew was taken into space, it would quickly overwhelm the air envelope. Instead a Longship in space usually carries about 20 men, which is still several times the safe amount. As a result, Longships tend to be short range craft, rarely taking journeys lasting more than 2 weeks. Longships powered by major or minor helms usually carry 1-2 priests of the Norse pantheon who will serve as helmsmen; however, the rest of the crew will be made up entirely of experienced warriors. Longships powered by Oars of the Void will often have crews with no spellcasters at all.
    Ship Uses:
    Raider: Much like their terrestrial counterparts, Longships in space are usually used for transporting raiding parties of warriors to attack isolated settlements. An ideal craft for carrying modest raiding parties, the Longship is small enough that it will frequently avoid notice on the way to its target. Often the first warning of a Longship attack is when the ship lands and begins to unload warriors. Longships perform quite poorly in ship-to-ship combat, however, and tend to avoid it whenever possible.
    Other Configurations:
    Modifications to the Longship are rare.

    Summary: |
    The Mammoth is a spelljamming ship built and used by ogres .
    Description: |
    The Mammoth is the pride of the Ogre fleets and is by far the largest ship ever produced by the so-called goblinoid species. The standard Mammoth displaces ninety tons, while larger variations (see the Archimperator ) range as large as two hundred tons. No two Mammoths are exactly alike, with subtle variations between each ship. A Mammoth appears as an oval ship with the head, ears, tusks, and trunk of a mammoth. The head is small, enclosing a single room from which a lookout directs the ship in battle. Directly ahead of the lookout is the trunk and tusks. The heavy wooden tusks are sharpened into piercing_rams to catch a ship and hold it while ogres board it. The trunk is a blunt_ram reinforced to absorb the shock of a ram and protect the Mammoth (the net effect of this combination of ram types is the same as a standard piercing ram, but this arrangement allows this to be achieved without the heavy metal reinforcement that would normally be required on a piercing ram). Ogres will carve steps into the trunk to disembark when the ship is grounded. The ears are thick and wooden along the innermost parts. Sails painted with fearsome images are strung between the spars of the outer ear, radiating out from the ship above the gravity plane. Head-on, the sails make the Mammoth appear larger and more fearsome. At the very aft of the ship is a rectangular tail that is the position for the ship's jettison .
    Mammoths were primitive ships by human standards. The ogres use stout timbers around a heavy frame of ironwood or oak. The hull is held together by a peg-and-slot method, where rectangular wooden pegs are pounded into slots in the hull boards. Wooden nails are driven into the boards to hold it to a frame of thick logs. The interior is made from unfinished timber; the bark is often left intact instead of stripped away. The boards in the hull are also likely left unfinished as well. Some ships will use a thick plaster to cement the timber together, though most ships do not have this innovation. Mammoths will be covered by hides sewn together to drive out rain and wind when planetside. Otherwise, Mammoths leak badly.
    Despite their primitive construction, Mammoths are rugged ships that withstand incredible amounts of damage. A standard Mammoth had four decks and displaces ninety tons. The ship will be armed with four heavy catapults , four heavy ballista , and a heavy jettison. These weapons will be crude and cumbersome by modern standards but serviceable in the hands of ogre warriors. Packed with as many ogres that could reasonably fit inside the stout ships, Mammoths set off in search of conquest. Inside, ogres will decorate their Mammoths with furs, mounted animal heads, and crude furnishings. Doors are either heavy affairs that require great strength to open (min. str. 15 to open) or are curtains of animal fur. Rooms are dimly lit with torches enchanted with continual flame spells. Ceilings soar 12' overhead in chambers and passages. Floors are creaky from ogres stomping over them and difficult to cross without making noise (-15% to Move Silently).
    The top deck of the Mammoth is an open deck for the weapons. The ears of the ship provide ogre warriors cover as the ship approaches its prey. Two heavy catapults with long arms are fired over the ears, directed by orders from the lookout in the ship's head. The ballista fire to the sides and aft, two per side or all four can be fired aft. The weapons are not turreted and are moved by the brute strength of the ogre gunners. The jettison can only fire aft and is only used if the ogres encounter a foe too great to easily overcome.
    Below the top deck is the upper decks. The forward room is within the ship's head and is an observation room for the ship's lookout. The lookout is always an experienced ogre who barks out his sightings to the captain below and the gunners above. Behind the lookout is a long room where the ogres keep their weapons, cloaks, bags, and armor on pegs along the walls. Before battle, ogres will muster in this room to arm and ready themselves. Alcoves are divided from the larger chamber by curtains of animal pelts. Ladders pierce the roof above and a pair of ladders nailed to the wall allow access deeper into the ship.
    The next deck down is the main deck, where the quarters of the ogres, the bridge, and even guest quarters are located. The crew quarters mirror one another in the forward half of the ship. The smelly rooms have bunks sized for ogres and a few chests for the strongest ogres to lock valuables. Wedged between the two crew quarters is an open commons area where ogre crewmen drink, play cards and knucklebones, and socialize. The walls are decorated with the stuffed heads of beasts, human skulls, and animal pelts. Behind the commons area is the bridge of the ship. The ship's charts and death helm are closely guarded in the bridge. Beyond the bridge are the quarters for the chief, the ogre mage, and guest quarters. The chief will have the best quarters available. A comfortable bed will be present, along with a wardrobe, a table and chairs, a choice of weapons, warm pelts on the floor and walls, and the best trophies. He will sometimes share this room with his wife if she is present. Opposite of his room is that of the ogre mage, who is responsible for guiding the ship through the stars. The furnishings of the ogre mage include a bed, a wardrobe of ceremonial robes, two or more tables covered by religious relics, and a weapon with religious significance. A quartet of guest quarters is aft of the rooms of the chief and ogre mage. These rooms can serve a variety of roles, depending on the alliances and needs of the ogre tribe. Sometimes, important guests such as ogre or orc chiefs will be put up into these rooms. At other times, subchiefs, women and children, additional ogre magi, and other leaders will stay in these rooms. If a Mammoth carries a large number of slaves, the rearmost rooms will be converted into slave pens.
    The bottom deck of the Mammoth is devoted to cargo and some mundane operations of the ship. The bottom deck is opposite of the main deck on the gravity plane. The two decks share opposite sides of the same floor. The forward half of the entire deck is a single cavernous cargo hold. The cargo hold is almost never lit. Crates, barrels, and sacks of stolen goods are tossed carelessly into this room. Access to the cargo of illicit goods is gained through double doors or hatches in the bottom of the ship. The hatches are heavy doors of wood that are laid over holes in the hull. A team of ten ogres is required to remove each door so that access to the cargo hold is granted. The rear half of the cargo deck is given over to a secondary armory, a sickbay for wounded warriors, a kitchen, and the ship's mess. The armory is where the ogres keep spare weapons and armor that they are not currently using. Spare swords, pole arms, shields, spears, and javelins will be stacked in the room, with more valuable weapons wrapped by furs for protection. The sickbay has a dozen straw heaps that serve as beds on the floor. The walls and at least two tables are covered with herbs and medical tools. One section is curtained off for when the cleric needs to amputate a limb. The stench of blood and death permeates the whole room and is noticeable throughout the entire deck. The kitchen is always active with at least one ogress and two or more slaves preparing meals for their ogre masters. The kitchen has a small brick stove, dozens of pots, pans, ladles, platters, and so on. Sacks of flour and baskets of vegetables are tossed into the corners until needed. Slabs of meat, sometimes resembling humans or demihumans, hang from the ceiling. After the meals are prepared, slaves carry them on overturned shields to the hungry ogres awaiting in the mess hall at the rear of the deck. The mess hall will be crammed with a large rectangular table surrounded by benches and stools. The tribal chief will sit at the head of the table during meals, where he will show off his latest trophies, brag about his conquests, and decide his next target of conquest. The ogres keep kegs of ale in the mess to have a steady supply when they are feasting.
    Crew: |
    The number of crew aboard an ogre-operated Mammoth varied greatly depending on the ship's use. A typical clanship would have a crew consisting of 20-30 adult male ogres, a like number of females and children, from 1-6 ogre magi, as well as anywhere from 10-100 slaves of various races. The slaves will typically be made up of a mix of humans , dwarves , gnomes , goblins , orcs , and kobolds . When possible, ogres would capture a few bugbears as slaves. These bugbears, being of similar mindset to the ogres, and nearly as strong, would usually be treated better and given authority over the other slaves. As a result, the bugbear slave overseers would usually fight alongside their masters against any would-be rescuers.
    The crew of a Mammoth operated as a battleship under a War King was very different in composition. Such a ship would carry from 1-6 ogre magi like a normal clanship, but the rest of the crew would be made up entirely of adult male ogre warriors. These ships would typically carry at least twice as many ogres as could be supported by the air envelope, making long journeys impossible. In some cases, War Kings were known to cram far too many ogres aboard a Mammoth, to the extent that the ship's air turned deadly long before it reached its destination.
    Non-ogre crews of Mammoths vary widely. Human reavers may have as few as 27 crew (in which case any battle will be won by bluff and bluster alone based on the fearsome nature of their ship), or as many as 70 or so for more successful vessels. The few human nations that use Mammoths as warships will generally carry a full fighting crew of 90, since the Mammoth will usually be the heaviest warship in the fleet, and will only be used against the most dangerous of opponents. Illithid slavers will generally have a crew arranged along the same lines as the crew of a nautiloid , but the Mammoth will carry significantly more slaves.
    Ship Uses:
    Clanship: The most common use for an ogre Mammoth was that of a clanship. The clanship, as the name suggests, would carry a single clan of ogres (including their adopted ogre magi), along with their slaves. Unfit slaves were served up as the ogres' next meal. The ogres were nomads in wildspace . They constantly moved from world to world, taking what they wished and departed before angry militias could muster and strike back. At times, clans sold their services to local armies as mercenaries. Many ogre clans found work with orc, goblin, even human and illithid navies. At other times, ogres were able to extract tribute from nearby ports and towns with the threat of invasion. A Mammoth clanship will typically be unmodified from the version given above. A clanship would often carry from 1-4 kobold Arrows or goblin Blades to serve as boarding boats.
    Battleship: A Mammoth operating under an ogre War King was operated as a battleship. As discussed above, these ships would be crammed with as many ogre warriors as possible. A battleship would usually be unmodified, but it was not uncommon for such a ship to mount an extra two catapults. Mammoth battleships usually carried from 3-10 kobold Arrows or goblin Blades as boarding craft.
    Slaveship: When operated by ogres, a Mammoth slaveship was simply a clanship with fewer ogres and more slaves than normal. Such a ship will often carry 1-2 Arrows or Blades for use as shuttles. The enclosed nature of the vessel, as well as its fearsome appearance, makes the Mammoth an attractive vessel for mind flayer slavers as well, however. Illithid slavers typically sacrifice the jettison and 4 other large weapons (the exact weapons depend on the preferences of the crew - all weapons removed from these ships are usually installed on other illithid vessels or bases), and sacrifice some armour. This raises the amount of available cargo space to 61 tons, although AR drops to 6. When possible an illithid slaveship will be equipped with a major helm powered by a captive spelljammer, but otherwise the original death helm will be used, despite its detrimental effects on the slave population. A Mammoth slaveship operated by mind flayers will usually be escorted by at least one Nautiloid.
    Reaver: Some few human reavers have been able to acquire and use these massively powerful vessels as raiding ships. Such a reaver captain must be extremely bold, since a Mammoth attracts more attention from local authorities and pirate-hunters than a smaller, more common vessel would. These reavers will usually dispense with the jettison and often one or more other weapons as well in order to gain more cargo space. Often this extra cargo space is converted into luxurious living quarters for the captain. Often a reaver Mammoth will make up for its lack of maneuverability by carrying several Blades, Wreckboats , or Flitters to support it in battle. Some captains have been known to replace the entire tail assembly with a docking port for a Wreckboat which serves as an escape craft.
    Other Configurations:
    Mastodon: These rare variants of the standard Mammoth mount an armoured dome, giving them a hunch-backed appearance. This dome contains three bombards, along with stores of smokepowder. The dome itself is intended to contain any explosion in the powder stores, so that it won't damage the rest of the ship. If the powder ignites, the resulting explosion will destroy the dome and all of its contents, but will inflict only 1-10 hull points of damage on the Mastodon, rather than the normal 10-50. In addition, the entire dome can be jettisoned if needed, either to prevent an imminent explosion from causing any damage at all to the Mastodon, or to serve as a powerful one-shot weapon in an emergency (in such a case, treat the dome as a heavy jettison attack for purposes of range and THAC0, but a successful hit will do damage as a heavy catapult, plus 1-10 hull points of damage if the powder explodes - if the crew of the bombards has at least 4 rounds to prepare the dome can be made into a more powerful bomb by removing some of the internal bracing, in such a case the explosion will cause 2-20 hull points of damage). The remainder of a Mastodon's weapons consist of a single heavy catapult, and two heavy ballistas. Bombard gunnery aboard a Mastodon is an unpopular duty, often given as punishment. The dome has no hatch leading to the interior of the ship, and must be entered by climbing along the outside of the hull along hand-lines.

    Summary: |
    The Man-O-War is a spelljamming ship built and used by elves .
    Description: |
    Built on the largest grown hull commonly available in space , the Elvish Man-O-War is an extremely versatile craft. Its basic design is derived from the much smaller Elvish Cutter , but the Man-O-War is a much sturdier and heavily armed warship. The ship follows the same basic forms of all elvish ships; a titanic butterfly in space.
    In its basic form, the Man-O-War is a far-ranging warship. Its weapons are distributed throughout the craft for advantageous firing positions and to prevent a single mass damage spell from disabling them all. The "head" of the craft serves, like on the Cutter, as a weapons pit for two medium ballista . Unlike the cutter, the head is much bigger and there is room for a medium catapult on top. This catapult does not take up the entire space, as elvish archers like to use the forward deck as the prime position for them to rain down their deadly arrows on enemy ships. Behind the catapult is the bridge, where the captain commands the ship. He communicates with the rest of the ship via voice tubes (sometimes magical). The helm is located here as well, reducing risks of miscommunication between the captain and the helmsman. Above the bride is another catapult, protected in a turret.
    Behind the bridge is a massive open space, capped by a hemispherical glass ceiling. This space was purposely added by elvish designers to make the craft one of the most versatile in space. It is easily modifiable, and can be changed to suit the needs of the ship's owner or the mission. At times, it serves as a garden, a barracks, a cargo bay, or a hanger. Ships that have fallen into other races' hands have a variety of other uses for this space as well.
    Beyond this space is the quarters of the captain and his officers. Their quarters are the most spacious and of the best quality on the ship. Above the officer quarters is the flight deck, which serves as landing platform for flitters of the Navy. The rear section of the flight deck is another weapons platform for two more medium ballista.
    The main deck, below the command deck, is the largest section of the craft. The quarters of the sailors, marines, and the weapon teams are all located on this deck. Guest quarters and even a brig are also located on this deck.
    The lowest deck, with an opposite gravity plane than the upper decks, is the observation deck. The galley, mess hall, and special rooms for mages are all part of this deck. Some ships have libraries and magical labs for onboard mages, while others convert the space into quarters for priests.
    Crew: |
    An elvish Man-O-War needs surprisingly few men to fly or fight. A mere dozen sailors are needed to keep the vast wings of the craft under control. Another twenty elves are needed to man all the weapons, leaving almost thirty elvish marines and archers to conduct boarding operations and man archery nests. The captain, the helmsman, the ship's primary mage, and at least four guards will always be located on the bride. Archers will be located on the forecastle and the flight deck. Marines pretty much roam the rest of the ship, filling in for those who fall in battle and stand ready for boarding actions.
    Ship's Uses:
    Patrol: One of the primary purposes of the Man-O-War is as a deep range patrol ship. The elves have special configuration for this type of mission. The multi-purpose space behind the bridge is converted into a massive garden. This garden, lit by magical lights and watered by magical spells, is large enough to freshen the entire air envelope. In this fashion the craft can remain in deep space for as long as the food and water holds out. Some craft equipped with magical items can remain in space for years at a time. This is the type of craft most often encountered by ships of other races in space. It is also the most common warship of the fleet.
    Light Carrier: This type of ship is not commonly seen these days. The armada has replaced most of these craft, but they are still seen in some spheres. To fill this role, the multi-purpose space is converted into a hanger for two flitters, with another two flitters able to attach on the roof of the hanger. To launch, there is a large set of doors set in the side of the ship. A flitter is attached on top of each wing, and another flitter is hung underneath each wing. One last flitter is docked on the flight deck. In total, this ship is capable of launching a squad of nine flitters. This type of ship is most commonly used to support command ships and is most often found in larger fleets. Typically, 1-4 of these ships will be found in the larger fleets.
    Troop Carrier: Sometimes the Fleet will have need to transport a large number of troops over a long distance. The Patrol-configured Man-O-War is especially good for this, as the interior garden provides enough air for almost 200 people. Typically, a troop carrier will have a full crew in addition to fifty-to-one hundred and fifty additional troops. Parts of the ship may be converted into barracks to house so many men. However, with the need for air eliminated, the elves can transport the troops farther and faster than fleets using more conventional ships. These ships are either converted to make landings or have a number of flitters onboard (attached to the wings) to deploy troops.
    Trader/Cargo Hauler: The most common non-military craft the elves use, a trader Man-O-War most often converts the garden into a second cargo hold. This gives them an additional 12 tons of cargo space. This modification is most commonly seen on in-system traders; most flow-running traders forgo the additional cargo space for the advantages of the large garden. The Fleet sometimes uses this configuration of Man-O-War to support their larger fleets.
    Command Craft: In the days before the elvish Armada, this craft was a common sight. They served as flagships for virtually every fleet the elves had. However, recently, they were replaced by the Armada. Most were converted into deep patrol craft, while others were mothballed. They are now found in spheres without a large elvish presence (such as spheres without any resident elves). These ships will serve as flag for a small fleet of 2-5 elvish cutters.
    For this duty, the Man-O-War's hull is strengthened to hold a pair of towers (located over the gardens). The first tower is two stories tall, and serves as a turret for an additional medium ballista. The two levels below the ballista serve as barracks and an armory. The second tower, over three and a half stories tall, is the office and private chambers for the admiral assigned to the craft. The tower also holds a room for his personal aide and secretary.
    Other Configurations:
    Saloon: In at least one case, an enterprising band of elves and dwarves have bought a Man-O-War from the Fleet and converted it into a roaming saloon. They travel the spacelanes, looking for ships with thirsty crews. The prices they charge are high, but men on long voyages with no sign of civilization in sight are more than willing to pay. They also sell star charts and directions to those that have become lost. Their ship, the Thirsty Tankard , is a welcomed sight in many spheres. Even pirates and raiders will not attack it; any ship that does can expect immediate attacks from ships the Tankard has serviced. Even the Fleet has toyed with the idea of introducing such craft into their larger fleets to boost morale.
    Temple: Sometimes powerful elvish priests will decide to go on long missions to convert elves in other spheres to their faith. To this end they use specially converted Men-O-War as mobile shrines. The crew are always drawn from the faithful and are loyal to the priest. With their faith guiding them, these brave elves search the spheres for lost elvish colonies and worlds that have not received the benefit of their "enlightenment." Depending on the situation, these ships are either welcomed or shot at on sight.

    Summary: |
    The Mantis is a spelljamming ship built and used by scro .
    Description: |
    The Mantis was specifically designed to combat the Imperial Elven Navy. Its grasping rams are designed to both grapple an enemy ship in the manner of a normal grappling_ram , and cause hull damage at the same time. Only one of the grasping rams needs to hit (THAC0 14) in order to grapple with the enemy ship. Each grasping ram causes 1-4 hull points of damage per hit. The Mantis also has a huge metal blade on its back, known as a razor back. This blade can cause 1-4 hull points of damage in a successful shearing attack, in addition to normal shearing damage. Two of the runners on the underside of the Mantis have the same usage, although both can be used simultaneously if the enemy ship is underneath the Mantis. The third runner is not as heavily-constructed, but can be used for normal shearing attacks. All of these weapons are designed specifically to be used against the wings that exist on most elven ships, robbing them of their vaunted maneuverability.
    The arms of the Mantis can be lowered to allow a better view from the forward portals, but the must be raised in order to land or attack. The Mantis can land on solid surfaces balanced on its three runners. The ship is watertight, but it rarely lands on water since its cargo doors are so low.
    Once a Mantis ship grapples another ship, a boarding party waiting in the sally room shoots down a slide mounted in the mouth of the Mantis. As many as 12 scro per round can board a grappled ship in this manner. The first 6 arrive in time to fight that round, but the others must wait for the next round. The slide is so slick that it is extremely difficult to climb it in order to board the Mantis. The mouth of the ship can be pulled shut, with 2 crewmen required to work the winches that open and close it.
    Since the scro consider personal combat to be an art form, the Mantis is not nearly as heavily-armed with ship-to-ship weapons as it could be. There is plenty of room on the top deck for more weaponry, but the scro prefer to cut and slice the enemy ship a few times before sending in a boarding party.
    The exterior of the Mantis is heavily plated with metal in order to protect it. This metal is maintained sufficiently to keep the armour at peak effectiveness, but the scro are unconcerned with aesthetics so the paint on the metal is frequently chipped off over large portions of the hull. The functional parts of the ship (the tips of the grasping rams, the razor back, etc.) are all kept in excellent condition, and are burnished and buffed regularly.
    It is suspected that the design of the Mantis was inspired by the orc Scorpion , and by the smaller human vessel also called the Mantis.
    Crew: |
    A typical Mantis will be captained by a 6 HD captain (or, in the case of a Mantis serving as a command ship, by a 8 HD Almighty Leader), assisted by 4 other 6 HD officers, and 13 4 HD sergeants. In many ways, however, the true authority aboard a Mantis will be the 5 war-priests found on board, each of whom is a 5th level cleric/mage. The war priests serve as spelljammers, navigators, combat support, and spiritual leaders. The remaining 52 scro on board will be standard 3 HD marines. This standard crew numbers 75 scro, a full 50% more than the tonnage can safely support for air considerations. The scro are unconcerned by this, however, since their war priests regularly cast Fog Cloud spells in order to refresh the air envelope.
    Ship Uses:
    Warship: The Mantis is intended for only one purpose: warfare resulting in the total destruction of the elves. These ships have formed the backbone of the humanoid forces in the second Unhuman_War . While not as common as some other ship designs, the deadly efficiency of the scro and their ship has made the Mantis the craft which has accounted for more enemy ships destroyed or captured than any other.
    Command Ship: The preferred command ship for scro fleets may be the Battlewagon , but such ships are exceedingly rare, and are reserved for only the most powerful fleets in the most strategically important theatres. Many scro Almighty Leaders unable to acquire a Battlewagon prefer other similarly-large and powerful vessels, such as ogre Mammoths or Smilodons , but just as many prefer to use the Mantis because, although less powerful in many ways, it is designed by the scro specifically for their needs. A Mantis operating as a command ship will typically carry 2-6 Blades equipped with boat helms to serve as messengers.
    Other Configurations:
    Firespitter: Some Mantis ships have greek_fire_projectors mounted in the slide in the ships' mouths. Such a Firespitter will grapple with an enemy ship, fire the greek fire projector (hitting a grappled ship automatically), and then disengage quickly before the fire can possibly spread to the Mantis.

    Summary: |
    The Mindspider is a spelljamming ship built and used by neogi .
    Description: |
    A new ship which has only appeared within the past 50 or 60 years, the Mindspider has been quickly gaining the same dangerous reputation as the more common neogi Deathspiders , and as a result they are usually attacked on sight by those capable of doing so. The Mindspider is lighter, faster, more maneuverable, and better armoured than the Deathspider, but since it is so much smaller it carries far less weaponry and marines. The Mindspider is used in situations where subtlety, or what passes for subtlety amongst the neogi, is needed.
    Crew: |
    A Mindspider will typically carry 1-3 neogi, each with a personal umber_hulk slave. The remainder of the crew (typically enough to give the Mindspider a full crew of 10) will be made up of lesser slaves placed under charm spells, or other enchantments to make them loyal to their neogi masters. Typical of neogi organization, all crewmembers are considered property of the ship's captain.
    Ship Uses:
    Command Vehicle: Most Mindspiders are used as command ships. This is done in situations where one neogi captain owns more than one Deathspider ship. In these cases the Mindspider will serve as the personal lair of this wealthy neogi. Races unfamiliar with this practice would usually assume that the fleet is led by one of the larger vessels, but in fact the relationship between the Mindspider and the Deathspider is seen by the neogi as being similar to the relationship between the small neogi and their large umber hulk protector/slaves. When a Mindspider is serving as a command ship, the Deathspiders in its fleet will perform any fighting, while the Mindpsider remains at a safe distance.
    Support Vessel: While the Mindspider was at first a very rare craft, in the past 10-15 years they have become much more common (although still not as common as Deathspiders). This has resulted in some very wealthy neogi fleet owners who have come to possess more than one Mindspider. In such a case any Mindspiders other than the personal ship of the Fleet owner (which will be used as a command vehicle) will be used as support vessels for the fleet's Deathspiders, much in the way that lesser neogi are often used in combat in support of their more powerful umber hulk slaves. These Mindspiders are intended to harass the enemy while the Deathspiders do the real fighting. Nevertheless, this is a somewhat risky assignment for the neogi slave-captains of these Mindspiders, since a Mindspider closing into combat is more vulnerable than a Deathspider doing the same. As a result, fleet owners tend to put their most ambitious (and therefore dangerous) slave-lieutenants in command of any Mindspiders acting in a support role.
    Piracy: A few elder neogi will break away from their kin in an attempt to avoid transformation into an old master at their fangs. These neogi, along with a few loyal umber hulk slaves and whatever other slaves they were able to retain, will typically flee from their fellows in a Mindspider. Such a craft becomes very dangerous, since the renegade neogi captain will usually be a total berserker, attacking any ship encountered in order to avoid leaving behind any witnesses who could potentially tell other neogi the location of the captain. These Mindspiders are often modified according to the whims of the increasingly erratic neogi captain.
    Other Configurations:
    Broodship Lander: The neogi are noted for their absence from large planetary bodies. Recently, however, there seems to be a neogi movement to settle larger worlds than their typical asteroid settlements. For these purposes, a Mindspider may be stripped of its helm, weaponry and crew, and let loose from a Deathspider in orbit. Such a Broodship will have its cargo hold loaded with an old master. The ship will then fall to the ground, crashing in the process. At this stage the old master will release the infant neogi, who will domesticate local slaves, and create a new neogi base which can then be used by their spacefaring fellows. The best part of this, from the neogi point of view, is that their own lives, and those of their precious umber hulk slaves, are never put at risk. This is the theory, at least. So far these experiments have failed, but sages are disturbed by this new trend, and believe that it is only a matter of time before the neogi succeed.

    Summary: |
    The Monarch Armada is a spelljamming ship built by elves and used by elves and drow.
    Description: |
    The Monarch-class Armada is an obsolete version of the more standard elven Armada . Monarch Armadas are essentially very similar to more standard Armadas, except that the "butterfly body" of the craft has been straightened and expanded, giving the craft a somewhat bloated look, and considerably increasing the ship's tonnage without increasing the length. The wings have been flattened so that their upper surfaces can be used as landing platforms for Flitters , but once they have landed, the Flitters are housed internally in a huge hangar bay, unlike the modern Armadas which simply carry their Flitters on top of and hanging underneath their wings. This hangar bay takes up half of the Monarch's cargo space, and is intended to carry 50 Flitters (the 2 Monarch-class Armadas operated by drow tend to carry a number of different craft in their hangar bays, most of which have been modified by the drow). Forward of the hangar bay is the ship's main bridge, while the auxiliary bridge with the backup helm can be found to the aft of the hangar bay. The rest of the usable portion of the Monarch is made up of an internal "citadel" which houses crew quarters, and other essential ship functions. Several gunnery platforms are found throughout the ship, but a Monarch actually carries relatively few large weapons for a ship of its size. Large portions of the internal areas of the Monarch are not usable, since they are filled with a honeycomb-like crystalline substance which maintains the vessel's structural integrity.
    The Monarch is, in many ways, a superior vessel, but there are a number of significant reasons why the design was abandoned after only about half a dozen craft were built. First and foremost amongst these reasons is the crystalline internal structure of the craft. In order to achieve a craft the size of a Monarch-class Armada from the fruit of the starfly_plant (which is the basis of most elven ships), significant magical changes needed to be made to the plant's internal structure. The result of this was a ship that does not have the natural resiliency of most elven ships, and which cannot heal itself in the manner of most elven hulls. Instead, while the ship remains alive, any damage must be repaired through a combination of standard repairs and magic (typically using Mending or Plant Growth spells). It is possible for all repairs to be made magically, but if an attempt is made to perform repairs in a purely mundane manner, the ship must save vs. crushing blow for each hull point of repairs to be successful. A failed save means that the effort has been expended to perform the repair, but the ship's honeycomb structure was damaged in the process, resulting in no significant progress. If the save is failed on a natural 1, then an additional 1d3 hull points of damage are done to the craft.
    The second major reason that the Monarch design was abandoned is the fact that the ship cannot be powered by a standard major_helm , even the most powerful varieties. Instead, the ship must be powered by a far more expensive series major helm. Since the Imperial Elven Navy is one of the very few space organizations which is able to produce major and minor helms themselves instead of purchasing them from the arcane , the idea of having to rely on the arcane for series major helms did not appeal to the admiralty. In addition, one of the regulations of the IEN requires that each command vessel carry a backup helm, which is not overly onerous on a standard Armada, but a Monarch's need for a series major helm made the carrying of a backup an incredibly expensive proposition.
    Finally, the Monarch-class Armada is able to carry more Flitters than a modern Armada, but not to the degree that would be expected from a craft that is twice the tonnage of a standard Armada. Unlike a modern Armada, this carrying capacity cannot be increased by carrying Flitters outside the main body of the ship, since the series major helm, as installed and arranged by the arcane, cannot move any extra tonnage over and above the 200 spacial tons of the Monarch. In addition, the Monarch actually mounts fewer large weapons than the modern Armada. While this can easily be remedied by the simple installation of more weapons, this must be done at the expense of cargo space, which is already effectively limited to 50 tons by the hangar bay. Alternatively extra space for weapons can be hollowed out from the honeycomb structure of the hull, but this is dangerous, since it will result in penalties to the ship's AR, and possibly penalties to ship saving throws.
    As a result of these drawbacks, the Monarch-class Armada was quickly discontinued. The existing Monarchs were sent to hidden locations, where they were to be held in reserve against the day when they might be needed to bolster elven forces. Unfortunately, drow spies determined the locations of two of these Monarchs, and managed to steal them. When the IEN discovered the theft, the remaining Monarch-class ships were returned to service, largely to prevent them from falling into the hands of enemies.
    Crew: |
    The Monarch-class Armada tends to carry a crew which is virtually identical in size and organization to that of a modern Armada. The Monarchs which are in the hands of drow, however, follow a much looser command structure, with crew positions determined largely by politics and the whims of the most powerful priestesses aboard.
    Ship Uses:
    Command Ship: All Monarchs, whether operated by the IEN or by a drow nation, are used as command ships. Despite their drawbacks, the huge ships are powerful and impressive. Monarchs serve well as command vessels, leading fleets of lesser ships. The only thing that varies from Monarch to Monarch tends to be the number and nature of the ships which it leads. This fleet includes the craft that the Monarch itself carries, but also includes numerous other ships.
    Other Configurations:
    Drow Monarch: The Monarch-class Armadas operated by the drow have been slightly modified to serve their purposes. In most respects the Monarch, with its enclosed hangar bay and lack of exposed decks, was already well-suited to the light-hating drow. These ships have been changed somewhat from their original configurations, however, with the addition of protective domes over the bombard turrets, and the darkening of the portals on the ships. Providing similar domes over the fore and aft gunnery platforms has proved impractical, due to the difficulty of coordinating the openings in the domes for the multiple weapons which may be firing at multiple targets.

    Summary: |
    The Mosquito is a spelljamming ship built by humans and used by most spacefaring races.
    Description: |
    This light, slim vessel, along with the elven Flitter , is one of the smallest helm-powered ships in common use throughout known space . The Mosquito is used as a shuttle, landing craft, spy ship, and infiltrator. Its small size makes it unsuitable in combat, since one good hit from a heavy weapon can often knock it out.
    Crew: |
    The Mosquito can be run at full rigging by a single man, yet it is large enough to allow some comfort, making it prized as a personal star-traveler. The small size of the ship makes it suitable only for carrying small parties, or for short trips for larger parties.
    Ship Uses:
    Landing Craft: Many Mosquitos are carried on, or towed by larger ships and used as shuttles or landing craft for individual crew members. This is particularly popular for ships which cannot land themselves (elven craft have been known to use Mosquitos in this fashion, although they more often use Flitters). The ability of the Mosquito to land on either land or water is highly prized for this use. These ships generally serve double duty as rescue craft and lifeboats as needed. Mosquitos used as landing craft will usually be equipped with relatively cheap boat helms, or even with conventional engines.
    Spy Ship/Infiltrator: The Mosquito is not made to stand up to a fight, but it makes a great stealth ship. Mosquitoes can be easily modified and made harder to detect, making them prime candidates for use as spy ships.
    Personal Transport: A large number of Mosquitoes are used by lone-wolf types who prefer their own company to that of others. These individuals ply the spacelanes following a myriad of different individual goals. Some are smugglers, some are bounty hunters, some are explorers, some are wizards performing research. The only thing that these Mosquito captains have in common is the desire for solitude.
    Adventurer Craft: The size and flexibility of the Mosquito makes it an excellent choice for small bands of adventurers, as long as those adventurers don't plan to engage in space-based combat.
    Other Configurations:
    Space Hulk/Bomb: In some areas of space with longstanding wars, Mosquitoes have been stripped of their helms and cast adrift after being filled to the brim with greek fire canisters and other flammables. In some cases these are booby-trapped to ignite and explode if boarded, while in other cases they are intended to fall into the gravity of enemy worlds or asteroids, crashing and exploding.
    Gnat: A stripped-down version of the Mosquito, the Gnat is highly maneuverable. Its AR is reduced to 7, but MC is increased to B. Some Gnats will also be topped-out to further increase MC to A, although this raises the minimum crew requirement to 2. Gnats are often used as shuttles in high-combat zones where their excellent maneuverability allows them to evade enemies.
    Stinger: In this configuration, the Mosquito's tail cargo-section is filled with weaponry, typically a medium ballista , catapult , or jettison depending on the tastes of the user. Stingers are usually used for relatively short voyages. In particularly dangerous areas of space the Stinger configuration is combined with the Gnat configuration to serve as a priority personnel shuttle.
    Domed Deck: This enclosed version of the Mosquito (or, occasionally, the Gnat) has a dome covering the upper deck. The Domed Mosquito is used by mind_flayers , and other beings sensitive to light. The dome does not affect the AR or saving throws of the craft, but prevents those on the upper deck from being attacked directly.

    Summary: |
    The Nautiloid is a spelljamming ship built and used by illithids .
    Description: |
    The Nautiloid is the standard ship of the line of the various illithid nations, and reflects the nature of the race. Its coiled shell provides the comfort of enclosed spaces while protecting the mind flayers from the irritating rays of the sun .
    Crew: |
    A standard mind flayer crew numbers 10 illithids, plus 2-5 additional mind flayers, depending on the number of series_helms in use. The number of helms determines the SR of the ship. A mind flayer ship has a single captain and first officer, with the remainder of the illithids on board being crew. A Nautiloid will also typically carry between 12 and 20 slaves, which will usually be humans , dwarves , elves , or other demihumans. The illithids prefer to use expendable slaves to man the weapons, while the mind flayers remain safely within the ship's armoured shell. The slaves are also used as boarders in combat (backed up by illithid mind blasts), and as rations on long voyages, so the rate of attrition amongst them is high. The captain oversees the ship from the command station, while the first officer is usually stationed near the catapult on the battle deck. Since the battle deck is the most likely place for any enemy boarders to attack the ship, it is a dangerous location, so the first officer's position is not envied. As a result, the first officer is usually conspiring to take the place of the captain. No position is completely safe on a mind flayer ship, however, since assassination is a relatively common form of illithid advancement.
    Ship Uses:
    Piracy: Nautiloid pirates are relatively common, and use the configuration and crewing given above. Nautiloid pirates are always looking to replenish their stock of slaves, as well as take anything that isn't nailed down from other ships. Typical tactics involve firing off a salvo from the weapons before ramming and boarding, using mind blasts and other mental powers to incapacitate as many enemy crew as possible, while the slaves fight those enemies who are still able to fight back. Since it is not obvious at first glance if a given Nautiloid is a pirate or a trader, most other races attempt to avoid Nautiloids wherever possible, although in some areas of space they are attacked on sight (most organizations put up with them, however, since illithid traders often form a significant part of the economy).
    Trader: As the workhorse of the illithid fleets, many Nautiloids are used as trade ships. Nautiloid traders appear identical to Nautiloid pirates or military ships, but will typically carry a skeleton crew of 2-5 mind flyers to man the helms, the captain and first officer, along with 6-10 slaves to help with handling the ship. Nautiloid traders will attempt to avoid a fight where possible.
    Military: Nautiloids also form the backbone of illithid navies, and, for their size, are one of the best combat vessels in space. Nautiloids serve equally well as pure combat ships, patrol vessels, and as light troop transports. Light combat duty is usually handled by the smaller illithid Lance. Since the introduction of the pool helm, the larger Dreadnought has begun to replace the Nautiloid as a heavy warship, but the Nautiloid is sure to remain the most common illithid military ship for years.
    Other Configurations:
    Added Armour: Some illithid captains, obsessed with staying well-protected within their Nautiloid shells, further armour their craft. This will typically take the form of armour plating (often bone or ivory, although metal is not uncommon), as well as thickening the hull and adding extra internal bracing. The result is a ship with AR 2, but with MC E and only 13 tons of cargo space. These ships are often used primarily for combat rather than as traders, and it is not uncommon for them to carry extra weaponry, usually a fourth ballista and a second catapult, further reducing cargo space to 9 tons. These ships are clumsy, but deadly, and should be avoided where possible.
    Added Speed: A common option for Nauiloid traders, this stripped-down version sacrifices armour for extra maneuverability. The MC of the ship is C, but the AR is reduced to 6. These ships will always either have a series helm with 5 mind flayers, or, where possible, will have a pool helm. In either case, the SR is an impressive 5 which, combined with the relatively good maneuverability, usually allows the ship to evade any enemies. Since these ships will typically operate with a skeleton crew, leaving no spare crew to serve as weaponeers, the weapons are often stripped, with the exception of the jettison , giving the trader extra cargo capacity.

    Summary: |
    The Nightwolf (or Vodoni Scout ) is a spelljamming ship built by the Zalani and used by the Vodoni and humans .
    Description: |
    The light scouting vessel of the Vodoni, the Nightwolf was the first of the Vodoni ships to be encountered in the known spheres . Appearing as a winged wolf in flight, the Nightwolf is usually painted blue or black, to make it more difficult to spot. The light, maneuverable Nightwolf is intended to flee from all but the weakest of foes, and is equipped with light weaponry which is designed to discourage pursuit. While many Nightwolves were captured during the fall of the Vodoni empire, many more of the fragile craft were simply destroyed in battle.
    Crew: |
    The standard Vodoni crew of a Nightwolf consisted of a single low-level breeder serving as the spelljammer and captain, along with 4 enforcers who served as bodyguards and weaponeers. Human crews will usually also consist of a single spelljammer and 4 weaponeers.
    Ship Uses:
    Military Scout: Most Nightwolves served the Vodoni as scouts, searching for new worlds to conquer and gathering information on enemy armed forces. The Nightwolf is well suited to this task, and since the fall of the Vodoni empire, most captured Nightwolves have been used by humans in the same manner.
    Messenger: Nightwolves were also frequently used by the Vodoni to coordinate fleet movements, and otherwise carry messages and orders from one end of the empire to another. Few Nightwolves now serve as messengers, however, since those that remain in Vodoni hands are now without an organization to carry messages for, and those that have fallen into human hands have typically been given over to other purposes.
    Smuggler: Most Nightwolves which are still operated by Vodoni have become smuggling vessels in order to survive. The crews of these ships will hire themselves out to anyone who is willing to deal with them, and usually find themselves transporting small stolen goods, often jewelry or magical items.
    Other Configurations:
    Courier: The Vodoni employed a small number of Nightwolves as fast couriers of light goods for their fleets. These ships sacrificed their two catapults , and moved the jettison to the top deck to gain an additional 2 tons of cargo capacity. Couriers were also topped out with a small mast for a lateen sail, increasing the minimum crew to 2, and giving the craft MC A. These Couriers were most often used to carry the specialized ammunition used by Hunter-Killers .

    Summary: |
    The Octopus is a spelljamming ship built and used by humans and illithids .
    Description: |
    A large ship reminiscent of the earthly cephalopod of the same name, the Octopus moves through the void in a manner similar to those creatures, its bulbous end first, trailing its armed tentacles. Originally designed as a convoy protector during the first Unhuman_War , its weapon layout earned it the nickname "tailgunner" (although its turreted weapons actually have an excellent all-around field of fire).
    The Octopus was the result of an unlikely alliance between a group of neutral humans and illithids. The resulting hybrid has many illithid design features, but was intended to be piloted by human mages, and crewed by a combination of humans and a few mind flayers.
    Crew: |
    During the first Unhuman War, the typical crew of an Octopus included 2-3 human spelljamming mages, a single captain (who might be human or illithid depending on the individual vessel), and 4-10 officers, about half of whom would usually be mind flayers. The remainder of the crew would be made up of normal humans. The total number of crew aboard such a ship was usually 40-45, which provided enough hands to operate the ship at full capacity, and man all of the weapons, while still providing a squad of marines for protection in the unlikely event that the Octopus was boarded. More frequently, these marines would be used as extra hands to replace any combat losses aboard either the Octopus or the ship(s) it was protecting. In modern times, the crew of an Octopus is typically made up of human pirates, and will usually number around 45-60 reavers. The organization of pirate crews varies greatly, while those vessels in the hands of adventurers have crews which vary even more greatly.
    Ship Uses:
    Convoy Escort: The Octopus was intended to guard convoys, and some of the ships are still used as escorts to this day in dangerous areas of space . During the first Unhuman Wars these ships proved their worth, since they were powerful and versatile. After the defeat of the goblinkin, the need for large groups of ships travelling in convoys for protection diminished, and the human/illithid alliance which created these ships quickly broke up. Most of these ships were retired at that time, and their equipment salvaged for use on smaller, more maneuverable vessels. Recently, however, an enterprising illithid discovered a forgotten depot with a number of Octopus ships. These ships have been refitted, and sold off to anyone who could afford them, and the ship has begun to ply the spacelanes again. In the current political climate in the spheres , the Octopus is once again useful, and new versions of the ship are being built at several shipyards.
    Piracy: The majority of Octopus ships in modern times seem to have found their way into the hands of pirates. Such vessels tend to pound their targets into submission before boarding, rather than simply grappling at the earliest opportunity, but this may vary based upon the temperament of the pirates. The appeal of this vessel to pirates can be linked to her good cargo capacity, her good maneuverability for a ship her size, and her ability to operate with a low crew, thus allowing most pirates on board to either man the weapons, or serve as marines. Because so many of these rare ships are used by pirates and privateers, a strange Octopus is best approached cautiously.
    Other Configurations:
    Illithid Octopus: A small number of these craft have been sold to mind flayer houses, and refitted with pool helms. These ships are usually plated with additional armour, increasing AR to 6, but dropping MC to E. Since only the most powerful illithid houses can afford the pool helms which these ships use, an Octopus is seen as a status symbol. Unlike the even more expensive Dreadnought , an Illithid Octopus is usually used as a private yacht by very powerful mind flayers, and as such is usually richly appointed.
    Heavy Frigate: Several of these ships have been modified to serve as heavy frigates. These ships have their bowsprits replaced with piercing_rams , and have their hulls thickened and reinforced to withstand the stresses of ramming. The bridge is relocated to the crow's deck, while the former bridge becomes a muster area for boarding troops. In addition, the forward half of the steerage deck is transformed into a gunnery deck, mounting 2-4 medium ballistas behind hatches replacing the fore portals. The Heavy Frigate is AR 6, and has 20-24 tons of cargo, depending on the number of medium ballistas carried.

    Summary: |
    The Porcupine Ship is a spelljamming ship built and used by goblins .
    Description: |
    The pride and joy of the goblin fleets, the Porcupine is a primitive yet surprisingly powerful ship. It takes the appearance of a gigantic spiny ball tipped with conical ram mines and an aft wooden tail. A fan-like sail, controlled by a dozen or more stout ropes, is at the end of the tail. A solid oak or ironwood door mounts the top of the tail, through which access to the interior is gained. The globe is pierced by four large ballista gunwales and a score of smaller arrow slits. The porcupine is a close range fighting craft, able to deliver a deadly attack when within 100 yards of a ship, but weak against ships attacking at a greater range.
    The Porcupine is grown rather than built. It is the seed pod of a rare plant found only in wildspace . The spiral-shaped plant is the created when a seed from the starfly_plant accidentally falls into a planar rift in wildspace (such rifts are often at the center of flame rings). The plant takes root in another plane, but grows into wildspace. The core of the plant retains a circular shape, often a mile across. Two to six trunks grow off of the main trunk, spiraling out into wildspace. Lesser branches and twigs intertwine into a net between the trunks and main trunk, attracting tens of thousands of wildspace fish, animals, and even scavvers and krajen . Along the outer rim of the lesser trunks, along the gravity plane, spiny ball seed pods grow. When they mature, the balls disconnect from the tree and fall into the depths of wildspace. It is these seed pods that the goblins take and use for their spelljammers.
    Near the time of maturity, the goblins prematurely disconnect the seed pods and hollow out caverns inside them. The largest of these seed pods produced ships of 45 tons, although smaller Porcupines are also possible. Weapons, a pump furnace helm, provisions, and a built wooden tail are added. Ram_mines are also added, usually to every third spine. The mines are created by the goblins from a concoction of tree sap, leaves, and scavver blood. The mixture created has properties similar to smoke powder, such that it is usable in ram mines but too dangerous for smokepowder weapons. An exploding ram mine causes 3-18 hp of damage to any exposed crew within 30' of the impact point (save vs. spell for half damage), and 2-5 hull points of damage to the triggering ship. While most of the force from this explosion is directed outwards, the Porcupine is often damaged by the explosion as well. To avoid any damage, the Porcupine must save twice against normal fire. A failure on the first save means that some flaming shards explode into the compartment closest to the exploding ram mine, causing 3-18 hp of damage to anyone within that compartment (save vs. spell for half damage). A failure on the second save indicates that the hull of the porcupine has suffered 1 hull point of collateral damage. If a Porcupine takes a total of 6 hull points of damage from this cause, the ship must make another save vs. normal fire, or have some spines catch on fire (treat as any other fire starting at a 1 HP size). A new save is required each time another hull point of damage is taken from an exploding ram mine, such that it is possible for several fires to be burning on the outside of a Porcupine simultaneously due to exploding ram mines. Given how cheaply goblin ships could be created, a tribe could easily support as many ships as they had warriors to crew them.
    The interior is a maze of small rooms and narrow corridors. The aft tail is the main cargo hold, where spare ram mines and booty is stored. The pump furnace is a large and bulky affair, often shaped like a large iron sphere with a grate and a pair of pipes leading out. The pipes lead out to the aft, blowing the blood red smoke out and past the sail. Chambers throughout the ship mostly serve as crew quarters, where as many as a dozen goblins sleep in ratty hammocks and keep their gear in leather sacks hung from pegs or nails. Tunnels are low, usually only 3' in diameter, and chambers are likewise crammed, with roofs only 5' high. Several tunnels and very small chambers are close to the outer surface of the globe are pierced with arrow slits or gunwales for the ship's four light ballistas. Each arrow slit has a light crossbow hung next to it along with a case with twenty bolts. The four ballista chambers are protected by thick wooden shutters that can only be opened from inside by means of a winch. Racks along the walls have spare parts for maintaining and repairing the ballista along with twelve to twenty javelin-sized spears for the ballista. The "bottom" of the ship has a fairly large hemispherical chamber where the goblins keep the wood for their pump furnace, which is often at least a ton or more.
    The exterior appearance is of a wooden globe covered by a forest of spines, each 8 to 16 feet high. Some of the spines are capped by ram mines, while others may be burned or broken, a sure sign of a veteran of other battles. The aft tail looks like a large wooden box rammed into the aft of the ship, contrasting with the rest of the ship. A fearsome face is most likely painted on the front of the globe, usually resulting in a comical looking ship. Goblins landing their ships on water often found that the Porcupine leaked badly (especially if any ram mines on the lower half of the ship had been used), which resulted in the sinking of many Porcupines. To avoid this, goblins sometimes landed their craft on land by simply pointing their craft toward the ground and drive the lower spikes into the dirt. The grounded spikes keep the ship from rolling away unless hit by a very strong, almost gale-force winds. Unfortunately, the ship is ill-suited to such a landing, partly because it will usually result in the detonation of several ram mines (unless they have been very carefully removed prior to the landing), and partly because the frame of the ship cannot easily stand up to such a landing, resulting in 2-5 hull points of damage for the ship, even from a controlled landing.
    Crew: |
    The crew numbers given above are for human-sized crew. For goblins the minimum and maximum crew numbers are 12/90. Porcupines would usually carry between 50 and 60 goblins. This would usually not be the entire tribe, but since the ships were so cheap and easy to produce, a single tribe would usually operate a fleet of 2-10 Porcupines (4-5 ships would be most common). A unique feature of the Porcupine is the lack of a helmsman of any sort. The construction of the pump furnace is such that it cannot be controlled by a mage or priest. Instead, the magical smoke is the force that propels the ship. The goblins channel it out a pair of aft "tail pipes", which pushes the ship forward. Maneuvering is done by manipulating the sail fins, which affects the flow of the smoke. Because there is no helmsman, the goblins must post a pair of observers, one each at the top and bottom of the globe to watch were the ship is going. The observers shout orders to the eight goblins who man the sail. Two more goblins are needed to keep the furnace stoked and fully fueled. Despite the lack of helmsman, the ship maneuvers well in combat when crewed by well-drilled goblins.
    Ship Uses:
    Warship: This was the normal use for a Porcupine. Although individually weak, a tribe of goblins was usually able to field several of these ships, making them a menace to space lanes. Porcupine warships won battles simply by swarming and overwhelming their opponents. A Porcupine warship would usually carry 1-4 Arrows or Blades to serve as fighters and boarding boats. These small ships would be lashed to the top, bottom, and sides of the Porcupine's tail, and would invariably be powered by non-magical engines. When the Imperial Elven Navy began the First_Unhuman_War , thousands of Porcupine warships were easily destroyed by the elves. The great advantage of the elven ships was their ability to hit the Porcupines from a distance, whilst out-maneuvering them to stay away from the dangerous ram mines.
    Trader: Some goblins actually used their Porcupines for peaceful trading rather than raiding. This was rare, however, since few races were willing to trade with them. In fact, the role of the traders of the goblinkin usually passed to the kobolds , who were much better at it.
    Explorer: Goblin explorers were really just goblin raiders searching for new targets. As such, explorer Porcupines were identical in equipment to warships, and like the warships tended to travel in small fleets. This was an advantage in that a single ship could be sent to investigate a world while the rest of the fleet remained safe.
    Other Configurations:
    Non-Goblin Crew: A Porcupine operated by a non-goblin crew will generally be greatly modified. This is typically done by removing the ram mines, building two sloping roof-surfaces on the top of the ship which rise to a central peak, and placing a pair of turretted medium ballistas on these surfaces. The ship is usually either fitted with landing skids, or has its lower hull properly sealed to prevent leaks when landing in water. This refitting reduces cargo space to 20 tons. A Porcupine modified in this manner will often be used as an explorer. This is because such a ship will usually only be used by inexperienced groundlings who salvage a Porcupine from goblin raiders whom they have defeated. Any other spacefarers will tend to use a Porcupine Ship only if they have no other alternative.

    Summary: |
    The Quad of Thay is a spelljamming ship built and used by the humans of Thay .
    Description: |
    The Quad of Thay is a unique ship design. Instead of having a defined helm and helmsman, the whole external ship (above and surrounding the living quarters) is part of the spelljamming_helm . This Grand Helm allows up to four mages to sit and concentrate their magical energies toward motive force. The level of each mage is added together and divided by four, rounding up all fractions. This gives the ship's SR.
    The four ram -like appendages above the ship's upper deck are used to concentrate both the mages' power and light from surrounding fire bodies and other sources. This magical energy and light is focused through two-inch triangular prisms inlaid on the four claws. This focusing effect causes the entire ship to be bathed in bright, colourful light for as long as at least one mage sits on the Grand Helm. This light causes all who attack the Quad of Thay to do so at a -4 penalty unless somehow protected from the bright light.
    When in combat, the Quad of Thay generally attempts to run away, since its only attack form is a ram using the magic-focusing claws. If these claws are used as a ram, and the attack roll is a 20, there is a 25% chance that 1d4 of the rams break off. For every ram that is broken, the ship loses 25% of its SR. Once all four have broken off, the ship is immobile.
    When in wildspace , the Quad of Thay can travel at double spelljamming speeds (i.e. it can travel 200 million miles per day). Unfortunately, due to the magical phasing that the ship goes through in order to achieve this, the Quad of Thay cannot enter the_phlogiston under its own power, nor can it travel in the rainbow ocean. Only by being carried by another ship able to navigate the flow can the Quad of Thay be transferred to another crystal_sphere . Because of this limitation, Quads of Thay have only been sighted outside of Realmspace on a handful of occasions.
    When travelling at spelljamming speeds, a Quad is unaffected by the gravity planes of bodies smaller than 200 tons. Normally a spelljamming ship encountering a body of 10 tons or larger must drop to tactical speeds, but due to the magical disturbance which allows the Quad of Thay to travel at such great speeds, the ship actually phases in and out the border ethereal, so it passes right by gravity planes created by smaller objects as if they (or it) did not exist. Likewise, a spelljammer travelling close to a Quad of Thay would not be dropped to tactical speeds unless the Quad itself drops out of spelljamming speeds. Very large ships, and other bodies of 200 tons or larger will drop the Quad of Thay to tactical speeds. When this occurs, all the mages (and priests if present) will band together to increase the ship's SR, and attempt to outrun any attacks.
    The cramped living quarters of the Quad of Thay are located below the gravity plane. The majority of the cargo space (and very nearly the majority of all of the internal space) on board the Quad of Thay is taken up with a large research library. Mages living quarters fill up most of the rest of the ship, with only a small space reserved for the ship's mundane sailors.
    Crew: |
    The minimum crew requirements given above assume that 4 helmsmen are manning the Grand Helm; however it can be operated with as few as 1 helmsman, so the ship could actually operate with a crew of 7 men without suffering any maneuverability penalties. The crew of a Quad of Thay typically includes only 6 sailors, all of whom are usually trusted (often Charmed ) warrior servants of the captain. The remainder of the crew is made up of at least 6 wizards, and in some cases as many as 20. The captain will be a high-level wizard (no less than 12th level, and usually greater than 14th), as will the first mate, and the chief navigator (no less than 10th level each, and usually greater than 12th level). These two officers may be firm political allies of the captain, or they may be highly experienced apprentices, but in any case they will be individuals whom the captain feels he can trust (as much as a Red Wizard of Thay can trust any potential rival). The rest of the mages will typically be 4th-9th level apprentices of the captain, and possibly of the other officers. Sometimes one or more priests will also be aboard, although such priests will always be devoted to whichever god the captain venerates.
    Ship Uses:
    Research: The only real purpose of the Quad of Thay is to travel throughout wildspace to perform research, track down new sources of spells and artifacts, and otherwise increase the magical might of the wizard captains, and their sponsors amongst Thay's Zulkirs. Those few ship captains who encounter Quads of Thay (usually commanding truly massive ships such as dwarven Citadels , or else encountering the Quad near a planetary_body which has caused it to drop to tactical speeds) are usually smart enough to leave the ship alone, since the crew can generally wield a remarkable amount of magic. Those who are foolish enough to attack frequently do not survive to make the same mistake again; if they are even able to get close to the Quad in the first place.

    The Quad of Thay is too new and specialized to see any modifications, although there has been some discussion amongst the Red Wizards of Thay about the possibility of arming the ships with either bombards or accelerators.

    Summary: |
    The Scorpion (or Scorpionship ) is a spelljamming ship built and used by orcs .
    Description: |
    The first Scorpionships began in the sweeping badlands of some forgotten world where colossal scorpions dwelled. The orcs discovered that the iron-hard exoskeletons of these scorpions could be fitted with decking, and used the husks to build their distinctive spelljammers. As the orcs refined their shipbuilding craft, they learned to build new Scorpionships without need of a dead scorpion's husk, although the vast majority were built from these exoskeletons.
    A Scorpionship is built from a hull of iron-sheen chitin husk or a frame of thick wood. Decks of duskwood, ironwood, or oak divide the top, main, and cargo decks. The workmanship is frequently shoddy and the ship is often in ill repair; orcs care little for the condition of their ship. Many patches identify a veteran ship. Rust, rot, and shoddy repairs plague many ships; more than one Scorpionship collapsed unexpectedly.
    The ram-claws of a Scorpionship are each operated by a single orc. Each claw can make 2 attack rolls with a THAC0 of 15 against a target within grappling range. If only one attack hits, then a glancing blow is struck. Roll 1d4, with results of 1 or 2 causing 1 or 2 hull points of damage respectively, while a result of 3 causes 2 HP plus a Ship Shaken critical hit, and a roll of 4 causes 2 HP plus a Hull Holed critical hit. If both attacks hit, then the claw has grabbed the enemy ship. A grab causes 3 HP of damage, a Hull Holed critical hit, and allows the ships to be grappled until the controlling orc releases the ship. A determined orc crew can dismantle an enemy ship piece by piece using the ram-claws, however it is more common for a Scorpionship to simply attack until it successfully grabs the ship, at which point marines will board.
    Most spacefarers speak only of Scorpionships, and, with the exception of the goblinkin themselves and the elves who hunted them, are unaware that there were actually three distinct varieties of the vessel. The reason for this is that the scorpions who provided the frames for these vessels went through several distinct growth spurts in their lives. This resulted in the gargantuan scorpions shedding old exoskeletons to make way for new exoskeletons that had yet to fully harden, and could therefore withstand the creature's sudden growth. Old exoskeletons that the scorpions had grown out of littered the badlands of this world, and a great number of these were used to construct scorpionships (although a shed exoskeleton was typically split into 2 or more pieces, rejoining these into one vessel was a relatively easy process).
    The most common variety of the scorpionship was the version which the orcs referred to simply as a scorpion. The scorpion was generally 150' in length and 40' in width. This version of the scorpionship was 30 tons, and was armed with 1 medium ballista , 1 medium catapult , 2 ram-claws , and a piercing_ram . The scorpion was commonly used as a raider, and as a general workhorse vessel by the orc tribes. These ships were feared throughout space , since the deadly ram-claws made them superior combat vessels for their size.
    It should be noted that even a spacefarer who is familiar with the different varieties of Scorpionships will generally have trouble telling them apart at a distance. This is because the ships all look virtually identical except for size, and it is often very difficult to judge scale in space. In fact, Scorpionships of all three varieties tended to use the same layout for the internal decks as well. This was primarily due to the simplicity of the structure, and the ease with which the orc workers could build the decks. As a result, the same deckplans can be used for the Scorpion_Scout , the Scorpion, and the King_Scorpion . The Scout uses a 5'x5' scale, the Scorpion uses a 10'x10' scale, and the King Scorpion uses a 15'x15' scale.
    Below the top decks is the main deck, with a small bridge, the controls for the claw rams, and quarters for the crew. The eyes are made of crude, opaque glass and are often tinted red. Small incense burners hang from the ceiling, filling the bridge with arcane smoke. Star charts hang from the wall, usually on animal skins. The shaman or witch doctor watches over the lifejammer, constantly chanting to make the magic work. Behind him, a pair of burly orcs operates a series of levers and turnstiles that make the ram claws move (note that only one orc is required to work each ram claw regardless of the size of the scorpionship). The orcs practice operating the weapons, and are quite good at it. The room doubles as a galley, with a cauldron in the center of the room where orcs prepare their meals. The orc kitchen is quite crude, with only the bare necessities. Meals consist of a watery stew, jerky, and an orc deviation of hardtack. Heading aft from the galley/claw control room is the crew quarters. Dozens of bunks are built into walls, stacked four high. Bunks are a right of the strongest warriors; an orc must earn his bunk through combat. Those orcs without a bunk sleep on the deck or the cargo hold. The captain's quarters are located at the base of the tail, the only private quarters aboard the ship. The best trophies will be located in his room.
    Below the main deck and opposite of the gravity plane is the cargo deck. This area is roughly oval shaped. Sometimes this space is subdivided into other rooms, such as an armory and brig for prisoners. The hold is filled with all manner of wares that the orcs might need or otherwise find interesting. A hatch offers access to the cargo deck.
    Crew: |
    A Scorpionship of any variety requires only a small crew. Triangular sails are strung between the tail and the legs. For the King Scorpion four orcs are needed to man the sails, while the captain shouts orders to coordinate their efforts. A sixth orc, a shaman or witch doctor, is needed to operate the helm. Scorpions reduce this to a helmsman, a captain, and two sailors, while a Scout uses a helmsman, a captain, and a single sailor. In addition to providing maneuverability, the sails serve a double purpose in blocking out hateful sunlight. The orcs keep the sails situated to block as much sunlight as possible. The remainder of the crew, usually about fifty orcs for a King Scorpion, thirty for a Scorpion, and ten for a Scorpion Scout, mans the ship weapons or waits for an attempt to board other ships. Larger than standard crews are not uncommon for ships on a raid, but conditions are abhorrent.
    Ship Uses:
    Medium Warship: Nearly all Scorpions served as medium warships, forming the backbone of the orc wolfpacks. Since most wolfpacks would have at most a single King Scorpion, the Scorpion was required to do most of the fighting when a wolfpack attacked. Scorpions were highly efficient combat craft, able to cause some damage from a distance, before moving in for the kill.
    Other Configurations:
    The Scorpion is not well suited for purposes other than combat, and this makes other configurations rare.

    Summary: |
    The Shrikeship is a spelljamming ship built by humans and used by humans, halflings , and elves .
    Description: |
    This slim, light raiding ship has been used as a fast merchant trader and a light warship by humans and halflings. It is a recent design, but is gaining popularity amongst private merchant traders. The Shrikeship is often used along with a major_helm to tow several cargo_barges for long-range or heavy-hauling voyages, but it is more frequently used for light shuttle-runs within a sphere .
    Crew: |
    Human crews of Shrikeships tend to number between 7 and 10, while the smaller halflings usually have crews of about a dozen. When used as a light warship, a Shrikeship usually carries about 20 men, but in these cases the ship is usually used for only relatively short-range missions.
    Ship Uses:
    Warship: Some human and elven fleets have added this ship to their planetary defense and patrol forces. The ship is considered graceful enough by the elves to include in their navies to supplement the grown ships for which they are known. The humans care less for the grace of the ship, and more for the Shrikeship's nimbleness and ability to pack quite a punch for such a small vessel. Sometimes a warship will be armour plated, giving the ship AR 4, but reducing MC to C. Elves will often modify the ship to land on water, adding outrigger pontoons for stability. Another common modification is to replace the central ballista with a catapult .
    Trader: Shrikeships used as traders tend to either tow cargo barges, as indicated above, or perform light trading runs, often in dangerous areas. In dangerous areas, the ship's maneuverability and weaponry allow it to succeed where many other light traders would be destroyed.
    Other Configurations:
    Messenger: This modification is being tested by several human navies. The messenger version strips the ship, worsening AR to 7, but resulting in a ship with an impressive MC A. The messenger Shrikeship usually also reduces weaponry to a single ballista, raising cargo capacity to 8 tons. The fast, nimble messenger is typically used as a messenger, as the name suggests, but is also being used to quickly carry needed supplies to navies.

    Summary: |
    The Sidewheeler is a spelljamming ship built and used by gnomes .
    Description: |
    Each Gnomish Sidewheeler is unique. Each ship is built from collected scrap, odd inventions, and leftover bits from other ships. Gnomish individualism and personality is found in each Sidewheeler, so no two look exactly alike. For that matter, the same Gnomish Sidewheeler will look different over time, as the gnomes modify portions of the ship to their own needs. New portholes and accessways cross the ship as weapon turrets are added and discarded. Gnomes are more interested in salvage than standard repairs and refit, so the scraps of two or more ships are often brought together to form one hybrid vessel.
    Given the unstable nature of gnomish vessels, there is a 50% chance that a given landing will result in a crash. A waterborne ship brought into space may have so much of its hull pieced and modified that it will no longer be viable on water, and will sink. Similarly, with the gnomish tendency to expand, it is highly likely that the gnomes will place additions on the ship without consideration of mundane matters such as landing gear. For example, former struts and landing gear may now be shorter than a recently-installed lighthouse on the base. The most common solution to this problem is simply never to land. Instead gnomes may use complicated versions of cargo hoists to take gnomes and cargo to and from the surface while the Sidewheeler hovers above. Another solution is some form of crash protection. The method varies from installing cloth webbing all over the ship as safety nets, to strapping individuals to the hull during landing, to filling the hold with feather pillows. Since bad designs in this area tend not to get a second test run, the chance of surviving a landing without incident is low. Sometimes gnomes will abandon ship before landing, taking lifeboats down to the surface (although if these lifeboats have been modified they may be just as dangerous). This guarantees a crash, but the gnomish crews can always rebuild their craft from the debris.
    Crew: |
    A typical gnomish ship has a crew of 21-40 gnomes. Due to the gnomes' small size, they count as half a human-sized creature for air considerations. Only the position of captain is usually fixed aboard a gnomish ship for any period of time. All other positions are filled on a rotational basis on a schedule based on a number of variables such as time, ship's position within a sphere , a phase of a moon on the gnomes' homeworld, or any number of other factors. As this often moves ill-suited individuals into vital positions, gnomish ships operate haphazardly at best. This week's chief cook might be next week's navigator.
    Ship Uses:
    Transport: Gnomish Sidewheelers are cheap, unreliable methods of transporting messages, goods, and people across the stars. If the sender doesn't care overly about whether the item being transported actually arrives, a Sidewheeler is generally the ship of choice. Sidewheelers are also the primary method of transporting gnomes and inventions (and sometimes more mundane goods) to and from new colonies.
    Exploration: Most Gnomish Sidewheelers operate as exploration ships, discovering different wonders of the cosmos. Gnomish crews and captains delight in finding new and interesting things, and testing all sorts of theories about them. Since gnomes keep such poor records of their travels, most gnomes can visit the same sphere a number of times, but remain convinced each time that it is their first visit.
    Other Configurations:
    Juggernauts: Gnomish ships do not usually carry large weapons. Neogi and mind_flayers have learned that tinker gnomes make poor slaves, after several ships were destroyed by gnomish slaves helpfully improving the rigging. Pirates likewise usually leave gnomes alone since they rarely have anything worth stealing. Despite this, Gnomish Sidewheelers do sometimes suffer attacks, and the Juggernaut is the gnomish answer to this. Up to 15 tons worth of weaponry will be packed aboard a Juggernaut, often in a seemingly-random layout. Gnomes will often mount more weapons than they can actually crew, since the extras are "spares." The weapon choice usually follows some sort of pattern - either all ballistas or all light weapons, or something else. In some cases, however, the weapons will be a random collection of experimental devices, many of which will not work properly in battle. Juggernauts sometimes have extra armour plating, improving the AR to 7, but reducing MC to F. Some Juggernauts appear exactly as other Sidewheelers, hiding weapons behind pieces of scrap until the last moment, surprising an attacker. Others follow the exact opposite strategy, blatantly advertising their battle-readiness, often with big glowing signs made from light spells saying "we're bad!"
    Speed Clipper: This version of the Sidewheeler is little more than a framework with a few level surfaces for the crew. Hammocks and netting hang everywhere to keep crew and cargo in place. The maneuverability of a Speed Clipper is improved significantly to MC C, but the armour rating is reduced to 8. Further, the ship cannot make a safe landing under any circumstances, and all members of the crew, including the helm and helmsman, are visible and can be targetted by weapons and spells since there is no below-decks to take cover in.

    Summary: |
    The Skeleton Ship is a spelljamming ship built and used by the undead .
    Description: |
    Some undead raiders have been spotted using the skeletons of gargantuan creatures as ships. The statistics of these ships naturally vary depending on the creature used, but a version built from a typical kindori skeleton is given here, since these are the most common Skeleton Ships. Intact and usable radiant_dragon skeletons are rare, and even then are usually missing portions of the tail and wing bones. What is left usually makes a ship around 10-11 tons in size. Skeleton Ships created from other creatures are even more rare, but there have been reports of a massive Skeleton Ship made from the bones of a stellar_dragon . This huge, snake-like ship is reported to be approximately 100 tons in size. The bones of Skeleton Ships are usually bound together with magical spells, allowing for strength and flexibility at the joints, but some of these ships are seen in which the bones have simply been lashed or wired together.
    Crew: |
    The crew sizes given are for human -sized air-breathing creatures. Undead have no such limitation, and as many as can hold on to the Skeleton Ship may come along, to a practical maximum of about 100, but most crews are closer to 20-30 strong. A typical crew may consist of a vampire, lich, or mummy captain (or in some rare cases a skeleton or zombie), served by 1-2 wights or ghasts, 2-5 ghouls or zombies, and 4-24 skeletons. Many ships have no ghouls or ghasts, but those which do tend to raid more frequently than other ships, since the ghouls need flesh for sustenance. A few Skeleton Ships have recently been encountered crewed by those rare undead known as true ghouls. These ships seem to belong to a unified nation of ghouls, although the exact location of this nation is unknown, since the ships so far encountered seem to be advance scouts.
    Ship Uses:
    Piracy: Undead pirates use these vessels to plunder and raid, mounting one ballista in the jawbones of the skeleton, and the other on its spine. The helm is supported by the belly-ribs. Often the helm of such a ship will be a lifejammer, in which case captives will be kept as fuel, often tied to a rib with all of their joints broken to prevent them from struggling.
    Personal Yacht: On occasion, liches may be encountered who have little interest in living creatures (except as a source of spell components, new spells, and magic items). Their crews may attack living spacefarers to gain magical treasures, or they may ignore them unless attacked. It is usually impossible to guess the motives of the liches who captain these yachts.
    Other Configurations:
    Firebomb: Some goblinkin have sought to load kindori skeletons with greek fire or other incendiary loads, and launch them as mobile rams when attacking bases and fleets. This works except that the targets can readily see what is coming at them, and can often cause the fragile ships to break apart before they get near.

    Summary: |
    The Skiff is a ship built and used by rock_hoppers .
    Description: |
    Rock hopper Skiffs are built for travel between asteroids . They are meant for short hops, and carry only enough air to travel short distances. These Skiffs carry no spelljamming_helms , and instead are powered by propellers operating from a turn crank attached to foot pedals. Unlike the elven Peddleship , there is no magic involved in this conversion of pedaling into motive force, and as a result the craft's SR does not rise above 1. The pedalers sit on benches set up much the same way as rowing benches aboard a viking longboat. A system of gears transmits their effort to a central drive shaft running the length of the Skiff, and hence to one, or sometimes two propellers at the rear.
    Rock hoppers are peaceable by nature, and their Skiffs are unarmed and unarmoured, the only weaponry on board being hunting harpoons. If confronted by a belligerent ship, a Skiff will flee if at all possible. If forced to fight, its crew will use poisoned harpoons to attempt to defend themselves.
    Crew: |
    Skiffs require a full 12 rock hoppers in order to function at full efficiency. This large crew means that only journeys that will take 2 days or less will be undertaken, lest the air become foul. Since the Skiff is limited to tactical speeds only, this greatly limits the ship's range.
    Ship Uses:
    Transport: Skiffs are the primary means of transport from one asteroid to another by the rock hoppers, and a clan will typically own several of these small ships for everyday use.
    Hunting: In addition to being used for simple transportation, Skiffs are used by the rock hoppers to take hunting parties out into space where they can use their harpoons to kill and catch scavvers and other spacefaring creatures that can be used for food.
    Other Configurations:
    The tiny Skiff is too small to be modified in any significant way.

    Summary: |
    The Smalljammer is a spelljamming ship built by the_Spelljammer .
    Description: |
    Smalljammers are miniature versions of the legendary Spelljammer itself. They retain the basic manta shape with the upswept tail, but where the citadels would be on the larger craft, Smalljammers have an enclosed cabin for crew. Instead of a landing platform, the bow quarters have a small outer deck as well as the command deck. While this is the Smalljammer's true appearance, very few see the ship as such from the outside world. A Smalljammer can project an illusion around itself, usually of an asteroid , space creature, or some type of ship, up to a maximum size of 50 tons. The illusion is perfect and undetectable until the atmospheric envelope is breached. The Smalljammer does not gain the abilities of the ship it imitates, however, which can lead to clues that all is not as it seems (for example, it would make a surprisingly maneuverable Galleon ).
    A Smalljammer without a captain can move under its own power at SR 2, but it is unable to reach spelljamming speeds. The only exception to this is on the Smalljammer's initial flight when it is "birthed" by the Spelljammer . At this time all of the Smalljammers travel at spelljamming speeds through the_phlogiston until each of them reaches a crystal_sphere . At that point the Smalljammer enters wildspace , and drops to tactical speeds. Like the Spelljammer , Smalljammers have the innate ability to open portals in crystal spheres, but these portals do not remain permanently open. Smalljammers can only be powered by major_or_minor_helms (and derivative helms such as crowns of the stars), or by an ultimate helm. Any attempt to power a Smalljammer with a different helm type, such as a pool helm, series helm, orbus , or other variant, will fail. A lifejammer or death helm will function, but will ultimately kill the ship. If such a life-draining helm is used, the Smalljammer must save vs. lightning once a day. Failure will kill the ship, turning it into a lifeless hulk that will decay in 1-10 days. It will still be usable as a ship until the end of that time, at which point it will break up. A captain with an ultimate helm will be able to power the Smalljammer as if the ultimate helm were a crown of the stars, except that the SR will be calculated as if it were a major helm.
    Crew: |
    A Smalljammer without a crew will make every attempt to remain hidden and inconspicuous. When in this state, the first person to board the Smalljammer and attempt to pilot it with an appropriate helm will bond with the ship. This person becomes the Smalljammer's captain, and enjoys an empathic link with the ship. This is similar to the relationship between the Spelljammer and its captain. The Smalljammer is like a child compared to the larger Spelljammer , and so it reacts more strongly and instinctively than the larger ship. If the captain acts in a fashion which the Smalljammer does not approve of (primarily actions which place the ship in danger), the helmsman must save vs. spells or suffer intense pain and take 1d6 points of damage. In addition, in dangerous situations the helmsman must make a save vs. spells or the Smalljammer will immediately flee at top speed for 1-6 turns.
    The Smalljammer only recognizes one helmsman, and any others who attempt to pilot it will be repulsed, being forced to save vs. spells or take 1d6 points of damage. This captain is the only helmsman that the Smalljammer will recognize until the death of the ship or the captain, or until the Smalljammer rejects the captain. Each time the captain performs an action that causes the Smalljammer to rebel, the captain must make a second save, this time vs. staves, or the Smalljammer will reject him. A rejected captain will lose his bond with the ship, and will be repulsed in the same manner as described above if he attempts to pilot the ship again. The next person to attempt to pilot the craft will become the new captain. Things which cause a Smalljammer to rebel include leaving it alone for extended periods of time, crowding it with other ships or potentially hostile individuals, inflicting damage on its hull or interior, and exposing it to frequent danger. The Smalljammer cannot keep a captain from leaving the ship, but it does maintain its psychic bond to a range of 10 miles, and will call for the helmsman to return. The Smalljammer is responsive to its captain, and will form internal walls, doorways, and furnishings from its living hull according to the needs of the captain.
    The strong bond between a Smalljammer and its captain, along with the extremely cautious nature of the ship, tends to result in extremely small crews. In fact, the crew will usually just be the captain, although it is not uncommon for a few of the captain's closest companions to be aboard as well. In any case, a crew of more than 10 is virtually unheard of. In any case, since a large portion of the Smalljammer's bulk is unusable as living space, a large crew would find the ship extremely cramped.
    Ship Uses:
    Lone-Wolf: The nature of the Smalljammer lends itself well to solitary pursuits, such as exploring distant reaches of the flow, engaging in research away from any distractions, and other such activities. Most captains quickly adapt to the Smalljammer's desire to stay in deep space, away from the potential threats that can be found in the busier spacelanes. Those that do not tend to find themselves being rejected.
    Other Configurations:
    The living nature of the Smalljammer makes most modifications impossible without killing the craft. While the ship can carry light catapults or ballistas , any larger weapons will be rejected by the ship, which will simply retract its leathery supports from the offending weapon (bolting it to the hull would damage the ship), and let it topple overboard. Smalljammers will never carry greek fire or smoke powder, and will react strongly against a captain who attempts to bring weapons aboard which use these volatile substances.

    Summary: |
    The Space Leviathan is a spelljamming ship built and used by an unknown race.
    Description: |
    Only a handful of badly-damaged derelict wrecks represent this type of spaceship. Extremely old and extremely large, these metal hulks of strange grandeur drift in widely-separated areas of known space. The arcane refuse to say anything about Space Leviathans when asked, even when offered money, and it is believed that the ships predate the ancient empires of the thri-kreen and the ogre_magi . These ships are large enough to serve as bases or even as hiding-places for conventional ships. Aside from the ram, which is built in, the armament listed above is the typical weaponry which will be found aboard a Space Leviathan which is serving as a base for modern interlopers.
    The metal which forms the hull of Space Leviathans is of an unknown type which is not easily worked, and which crumbles with age. As a result, Space Leviathans are useless as sources of salvage, although dwarves often obtain small samples for experiments. Strangely enough, all known Space Leviathans seems to have been somehow formed out of a single piece of metal; there are no seams or joins except where hatches, viewing ports, and obviously-damaged breaks are found.
    Crew: |
    Not enough is left of the interiors of any Space Leviathans to speculate what sort of creatures built them, other than the fact that they were obviously skilled at working metal. Some human sages believe that the size of the wrecks indicates that their crews must have been of giant size, but there is no proof of this.
    Ship Uses:
    Unknown: The original use of Space Leviathans is unknown.
    Base: Several Space Leviathans have been laboriously moved into position to serve as bases by humans, and other spacefaring races. These ships are typically armed as above, and serve as immobile bases for a variety of purposes, from defense to trade. Some pirates have been known to use these ships as bases, repair areas, and simply as hiding-places.
    Other Configurations:
    No other configurations of Space Leviathans have been found.

    Summary: |
    The Spacesea Giant Galleon is a spelljamming ship built and used by spacesea_giants .
    Description: |
    The Spacesea Giant Galleon is a large stone vessel with a virtually identical profile to the smaller groundling Galleon . Despite its appearance, the Spacesea Giant Galleon is designed for space travel rather than sea travel, and as a result its performance in space is comparable to that of a standard Galleon despite its larger size and stone construction. It is unknown why spacesea giants chose to model their vessels after a Galleon, but their choice of building material clearly stems from the fact that, like their groundling stone giant ancestors, spacesea giants feel more comfortable with a large mass of stone beneath their feet.
    Crew: |
    The crew sizes given above reflect a crew of human-sized beings. Spacesea giants, however, are large enough that each can do the work of 2 human crew members, with the result that as few as 11 spacesea giants can handle this ship at full capacity. Likewise, each heavy ballista can be operated by a pair of spacesea giants rather than a crew of four. Unfortunately, a spacesea giant consumes as much air as 3 humans. As a result, the typical crew size for a Spacesea Giant Galleon will be 16-20 spacesea giants. Each ship will typically carry 2 giant elders with stone-related spell-like abilities (see Monstrous Compendium for details), and these elders are capable of using their abilities, along with handy stone boulders, to repair the Galleon, even during combat. At least one of these elders (and possibly both) will be an actual spellcaster in addition to having spell-like abilities, and will serve as a helmsman. Whichever elder is not the spelljammer (or chief spelljammer) will typically serve as the captain. In combat, any spacesea giants not currently occupied with operating the ship or manning the ballistas will hurl boulders for 3d10 hp or 1d3 HP of damage.
    Ship Uses:
    Explorer: A large number of Spacesea Giant Galleons spend most of their time exploring the far reaches of space in order to see the glory of the universe that they believe their god Ptah created. Many of these vessels hire themselves out to different groups who want specific areas explored, while others simply explore wherever they please (and then sell the charts that they make along the way to anyone interested).
    Trader: The Spacesea Giant Galleon makes a good trade vessel, since it is capable of carrying a significant amount of cargo, and it is durable enough, and with a powerful enough crew that any pirate would think twice before daring to attack it.
    Other Configurations:
    Spacesea giants do not tend to perform many modifications of their craft.

    Summary: |
    The Spelljammer is a unique spelljamming ship from which the Spelljammer_campaign_setting takes its name.
    The Truth Behind the Legends:
    Name:
    The name Spelljammer is as old as travel in space itself. In the most ancient surviving relics of the past, the Spelljammer is described as it is today, still carrying the same name then as it does now. Despite this seeming connection, there is no direct link between the great ship Spelljammer and the various spelljamming_helms used by priests and wizards throughout known space.
    Built by:
    The present Spelljammer is a descendant of the original craft, whose own origins are lost in time and mythology. It may be that, like the crystal_spheres and the_phlogiston , there have always been spelljammers.
    Tonnage/Hull points/Keel length/Beam length/Cargo:
    Tonnage and cargo listings are estimates because no one has accurate numbers on a ship this large. (Also, such a large craft is usually not used as a cargo hauler.) In very real terms, the Spelljammer is immune to any conventional attacks a single opponent can deliver.
    Crew: |
    The Spelljammer has no living crew in the traditional sense. The ship takes care of its own maneuvering and power, either directly or through the use of servitor constructs called shivaks . These shivaks take care of the detail and grunt work and can be considered "monsters" unique to the Spelljammer .
    The ship carries over 5,000 living individuals who, in general, have little effect over the control of the ship. They are more akin to passengers than crew, but they are tied to the ship as well and will fight to defend it. These individuals come from all races and are separated into communities throughout the ship, with the various towers each being dominated by a single racial group. These racial groups fight among themselves, but this is permitted as long as these wars do not interfere with the ship.
    The Spelljammer continually releases magical scents and fragrances into its air envelope. These fragrances entrap the will of others and control the races that make the ship their home. Although these scents function in a very subtle fashion, they have the effect of a charm spell. Those living on the Spelljammer are positively disposed toward the ship, will fight to preserve the ship, and will otherwise act in a manner beneficial to the ship. This disposition is the reason why those who join the Spelljammer rarely leave.
    When an individual first enters the air envelope of the Spelljammer , he or she must make a saving throw versus spells. All modifications for race and level apply, but magic resistance is ignored. The elves ' normal resistance to charm spells and their other immunities are also ignored for the purpose of this roll. Creatures that do not need to breathe (such as golems, the undead , or clockwork_horrors ) are not subjected to making a saving throw.
    If the initial saving throw is successful, additional saving throws must be made for every 12 hours spent on the ship. Each is at -1 to succeed and is cumulative (after two days, the saving throw is made at -4). Failure of any of these saving throws indicates the individual has been ensorcelled by the ship. Those leaving the ship before being so enchanted and then returning begin the saving throws as if approaching the ship for the first time.
    Those magically charmed are unaffected in their normal actions. They may move and fight normally, even if they attack the inhabitants of the ship or the shivaks created by the Spelljammer . However, the following rules do apply to ensorcelled characters:
    Charmed individuals will not directly harm the Spelljammer ; they will not fire missiles at or use spells against the ship. Nor will they engage in acts known to harm the Spelljammer , such as using fire in the phlogiston.
    Charmed individuals will not seek to leave the Spelljammer . The individual can be carried off or knocked unconscious and dragged off the ship, but he will not leave of his own volition.
    If the individual is charmed by the Spelljammer while still in the ship's air envelope before he has landed on the ship itself, he can be carried away from the envelope without ill effect (the fragrances within the mixed air diminish over time). The exception to this rule occurs when spelljamming mages or priests are charmed by the ship. If such is the case, they will immediately attempt to land to become part of the Spelljammer 's crew. The remainder of the other crew must get another, unaffected wizard or cleric into the helm to make good an escape.
    The charmed individuals are not otherwise affected. It is not that they are forced to perform or not perform certain actions, it is simply that these actions never even enter the thoughts of those so affected. They will not prevent their friends and allies from harming the Spelljammer , but they will attack their potential foes who try to harm the ship.
    These individuals will retain their original drives and goals, provided those goals do not directly harm the Spelljammer . If an individual once desired to control the Spelljammer , he will continue to strive toward that desire, but he will be limited to only nondestructive means. In fact, he will be so wrapped up in attempting to control the great ship that he will never want to leave it.
    Removing the charmed individual from the air envelope of the ship negates the effects of this enchantment - in other words, the fragrances must be constantly inhaled in order to cause any effect. If the affected individual spends 2-12 hours away from the ship's air, he will no longer be affected by the ship's control. Additionally, an antimagic or a wall of force spell will hold off the magic-tinged air for the duration of the spell. A dispel magic will also negate the effects, but the ship is considered a 20th level wizard for the purpose of breaking this spell.
    The fragrances in the air are invisible, and their odor is faint. Usually they smell like something desirable or peaceful to the target - roses or pines to humans , fresh-baked biscuits to halflings , and rotted flesh to neogi . The air itself is magical, and a detect magic will reveal a swirling cloud of faint magic from the Enchantment/Charm school area of effect, in addition to any other magical effects.
    Power type/Ship's rating/Maneuver rating/Landing:
    The most surprising feature of the Spelljammer is her speed, which is incredibly fast for so massive a ship. Other objects of this size would be reduced to (at best) an SR of 1 - able to move but one hex on the tactical map per turn. The Spelljammer , on the other hand, has an SR of 8 and a surprisingly high MR, making the ship capable of pulling very high speed turns without affecting those on board.
    The Spelljammer lacks a command center per se - the ship’s consciousness permeates the entire ship. There is no "brain" to the creature in the usual sense, no location that can be struck or exploited to seize control of the entire body. Much like how the consciousness of the spelljamming mage seems to encompass an entire ship, so too the spirit of the great ship is everywhere through its body, concentrated in no one location.
    There is a "command bridge" located in the forward quarters of the ship, but this is usually sealed off and only available when the correct individual bearing the ultimate helm arrives at the ship. These quarters are tailored to match the needs of the individual's race and personal tastes.
    It is when the great ship is under the direct control of its captain that the ship is most vulnerable in that the captain is mortal even if the ship seems immortal. No other helms operate to control the Spelljammer , though they will operate on lesser craft that rest on the Spelljammer .
    The Spelljammer itself could conceivably land on both ground and water without taking severe damage. (It is known, for instance, that young spelljammers can and do land on both ground and water.) The ship's flattened bottom would seem to be ideal for such landings, but it has never been reported to have landed. This may be due to the personal whims of the Spelljammer itself or to the fact that such a landing could wipe out entire towns unless exact care was taken. Most likely, the great ship avoids landing on larger planetary_bodies because its protective charming ability over its inhabitants would be lost. (Such areas negate the fragrances' effects.) The ship's inhabitants would lose their desire to remain with the ship and could seek to harm it.
    The Spelljammer can cross between wildspace and the phlogiston at will, though it must still make the travel between the points. The Spelljammer does not need to seek portals through the crystal shell to do this because it forms its own portal when crossing between the Rainbow Ocean to the various solar systems. The portals so created become permanent, and they may be used thereafter by any ship that can reach them. Other forces may also create permanent portals, but only the Spelljammer has been seen creating these long-standing gates.
    Armor rating/Saves as/Magic resistance:
    Whereas most ships - whether the unliving, gnome ship of steel or the polished, living crystal of the elven armada - have a saving throw as per an item, the Spelljammer saves as a 20th level wizard. All forms of attack that do not fit under standard saving throws are determined as a save versus spells.
    In addition, the Spelljammer 's body has an innate magic resistance of 50%, such that its walls will often not be affected by fireballs or other fell magics. The Spelljammer is also immune to the effects of all enchantment/charm spells directed against it, including the effects of magical items and artifacts.
    Armament:
    The Spelljammer 's complement of weapons is large and is controlled by the various races that inhabit the ship. The large catapults and ballistas are in the hands of those who live in the major towers, while the smaller weapons are controlled by those in less powerful positions or are used to support the major weapons. Interestingly enough, the chief opponents of these weapons are other towers and races rather than invaders from space. Only in the face of a concentrated raid will the numerous towers combine forces against invaders.
    Contrary to previous reports, the Spelljammer packs no jettisons . (Earlier reports had confused a flurry of catapult shots with jettisons in action.)
    The previous reports of bombards aboard the Spelljammer are also partially false. In fact, there are never more than 10 bombards on the Spelljammer at any one time. Any additional bombards that fall into the Spelljammer 's hands are usually fought over by the giff , who place an ancestral claim on all large guns. These fights most often result in the destruction of the gun or in the giff acquiring the gun (and then firing it until it blows up). It is not known why the giff, who make their home on the Spelljammer , are so excited by this destruction, but it may be a side effect of the charm spell that the ship casts on them. The net result is that there are essentially no bombards on the ship (outside of those briefly under the control of the giff).
    The Spelljammer does have an additional weapon stored in its tail. The tail assembly can create a sphere of annihilation and can independently fire the sphere at targets. The sphere appears as utter blackness surrounded by a corona of bright, crystalline-white light, easily visible when fired.
    The sphere can move six hexes per round and can follow its intended target. It is 10 feet across and powerful enough to suck in any ship of 100 tons or less. The sphere strikes with the THAC0 of a 20th level wizard to hit against the ship armor rating. If the sphere misses, it will complete its movement for that turn in a straight line, then circle around to strike again until it either hits or the target reaches spelljamming speeds and outruns the sphere.
    The sphere can be affected like any other sphere of annihilation, but it cannot be used against the Spelljammer itself - if it reenters the Spelljammer 's air envelope, the sphere fizzles into nothing.
    If the sphere falls into the gravity plane of an item larger than 100 tons other than that of the Spelljammer , it will fragment into 2-12 smaller spheres of annihilation and scatter across the larger body. Control is lost over these items, and they are treated as normal spheres of annihilation.
    The Spelljammer only uses the sting weapon when it has a captain on board; in other words, when operating on its own, the ship will not use the spheres in combat. Only the captain can order the spheres to fire. This is one reason why many of the more recent tales of the Spelljammer neglect to mention this particular feature.
    The Great Ship in Combat:
    Moving the Spelljammer:
    The Spelljammer is a large ship, represented in the Adventures_in_Space SPELLJAMMER® boxed set by a multihex figure. The bow of the ship is considered the location from which the ship turns and moves. The bow will face one of the six hexsides of the forward hex it occupies.
    The Spelljammer can move a determined number of hexes only if that movement falls within the restrictions for long-range movement. It will not charge a sun , for example, or fly into the maw of a gargantuan spacefaring monster. It will pass through or over other ships, such that a charge at one random ship can carry the Spelljammer through that ship's hex and beyond.
    When turning the great ship, the wings and stern hexes will pass through a number of other hexes in making the turn before lining up in their correct position. All hexes that the ship passes through while making such a turn are affected by the wake of the Spelljammer (see the subsection below for further information).
    Sudden turns have no effect on the crew because crew members are totally within their own gravity plane. However, to an outside observer, such a huge craft making a 120-degree spin and then charging would be unsettling, to say the least.
    Long-Range Movement:
    If the Spelljammer is under the control of a captain (whether represented by a PC or an NPC under control of the Dungeon Master), its long-range goals are determined by the person controlling the character acting as captain. What spheres and planets to visit; what actions to take; and who to contact, fight, or take on board are all up to the individual. The Spelljammer will respond immediately.
    This is not to say that the ship will continually engage in foolish or suicidal actions at the request of its captain. The Spelljammer has a mind and a will of its own, and while it will usually submit that will to its captain, it will protest if necessary.
    The nature of this protest will not be an actual command against the action, but rather a "second thought" to the captain himself. If the PC acting as captain suggests that they land the Spelljammer on water (something the ship would not do on its own), the DM should merely say, "You don't think that's a good idea." If the player presses, the Spelljammer will perform the requested action, but the override is nevertheless noted.
    The Spelljammer 's general restrictions for movement are to:
    Never land on planets. This extends to any solar body larger than itself that may or may not have an atmosphere. Entering such an area causes the magical scents that control the populace to be diminished or eliminated. Passing through the air envelope of a larger body is permissible, provided the contact is no more than two turns (the time it would take some of the enchanted inhabitants to come out of their spell).
    Never act to harm the inhabitants of the ship. This includes trying to bleed off the atmosphere entirely, taking on a hundred beholder ships in a fight, and the like. This restriction also includes attempts to remove one particular life form or another from the ship, with the exception of the undead. Whether the captain likes neogi or not, their establishment will remain on the ship.
    In addition to the Spelljammer 's particular restrictions, the ship prefers its captains to observe the following ones as well, including to:
    Never use fire in the phlogiston. A commonsense restriction, since the flammable vapors would otherwise combine with those in the Spelljammer 's air envelope. Even the giff will not fire in the flow.
    Never try to destroy the Spelljammer . Patently obvious suicidal actions such as plunging the Spelljammer into a fire body will be strongly discouraged.
    Never attempt to leave. Once a captain is installed, the ship will want him or her (or it, for that matter) to remain. This restriction will be invoked instantly. If a captain still attempts to leave, the Spelljammer will try to stop him or her.
    Never let any other inhabitant leave. This regulation is less heavily enforced than the other ones, but the Spelljammer likes to maintain its myth and mystique as a protective shield against others, and thus it doesn't like inhabitants (who will certainly divulge whatever secrets they have learned) to escape. There are those who do succeed in escaping the Spelljammer , but they are few and far between.
    If the ship is not under the control of any one individual, its actions become more erratic. The DM can determine the Spelljammer 's actions on his or her own, according to the needs of the campaign. (If, for instance, it is necessary for the current adventure's plot to have the Spelljammer stay in orbit around Greyhawk for a few days, then so be it - do not let the dice blindly control your campaign!)
    For general movement of the Spelljammer , roll on the table below. Make one roll every six hours.
    In addition, there will be situations where survival of the Spelljammer will obviously override any die rolls. The appearance of a large fleet of hostile ships (40 or more - any fewer will be ignored) will cause the Spelljammer to move off in another direction, attaining spelljamming speeds as soon as possible. Further, stellar events such as exploding planets and stars as well as huge monsters (for example, a rogue_moon or murderoid ) will cause the Spelljammer to leave the area quickly.
    Tactical Movement:
    Like any other ship in space, the Spelljammer moves at spelljamming speeds as long as it is not in contact with other large bodies (10+ tons). For example, the presence of an elvish flitter can prevent the Spelljammer from attaining its high speeds. When reduced to tactical movement (on the hexgrid provided in the original SPELLJAMMER® set), the Spelljammer 's SR of 8 makes it an incredibly fast and dangerous opponent.
    Again, ships under the control of a captain (whether a player character or a nonplayer character under the control of the DM) move and fight according to the desires of the captain. The rules regarding the Spelljammer 's influence apply to tactical as well as to long-range movement. In other words, the ship will seek to avoid entering large gravity fields or engaging overwhelming enemies.
    For ship actions when not under the control of a captain, the DM can determine the ship's movements according to his own needs, or he can roll on the following table, checking every 1-6 rounds or at his preference.
    For the distance moved in Table 2, roll a 10-sided die and check the following table.
    The DM can override these tables any time (even after the roll), if it suits his or her purpose. These tables are included as guidelines only. Keep in mind that this method of random movement will produce a "drunkard's walk" for the Spelljammer - a series of unrelated movements, but this can be explained as the unpredictable nature of the craft.
    Combat with the Spelljammer:
    The Spelljammer is not by its nature an offensive weapon. Its very size is protection against all but the largest of creatures in wildspace; where its size does not protect it, its speed and dexterity more than make up for its lack of offensive weapons.
    However, the Spelljammer does have three main attacks: the wake of its gravity field, its sting, and that of its inhabitants.
    The wake attack is usually used to discourage rather than defeat opponents (primarily other ships). The sight of a nearly quarter square mile of real estate moving in at spelljamming speeds tends to turn away all but the most determined attackers. (See below for further information on the wake attack.)
    The sting of the Spelljammer (previously described in the armament information given in "The Truth Behind the Legends," above) will only function when it has a captain in residence. It may be that the ship only uses the spheres of annihilation to protect its captain when he or she is on board. The use of the sting is the captain's prerogative, and the captain will know of its existence once he or she communes with the Spelljammer using the ultimate helm.
    The sting of the Spelljammer is mounted in the curved tail section of the craft; as such, it can only fire at targets that are initially in the "front" of the ship. Thus, only those who are in front of the forward three hexes of the Spelljammer may be fired at. However, the spheres do track their opponents and, once fired, the Spelljammer may change course and ignore its prey. Any number of spheres may be fired, but only one may be fired per turn.
    Lastly, the inhabitants of the Spelljammer have a variety of weapons available to them - catapult, ballista, and the very rare bombard. As stated under the armament information in "The Truth Behind the Legends," above, these weapons are used primarily to attack each other, but they can also be aimed at outside targets.
    There is a base 10% chance that any ship that enters the Spelljammer 's air envelope will be attacked by a large weapon. In cases where there are numerous ships in the area, the chance of being shot at increases dramatically. The 10% chance is modified by the following:
    A +20% if the ship is one that normally belongs to a racial enemy of one of the races on board.
    A +30% if the ship has previously fired at the Spelljammer .
    A +50% if one to three opposing ships are near the Spelljammer .
    A +70% if more than three opposing ships are in the area.
    The percentages are cumulative, with a maximum of +90%. If a ship takes one shot from the Spelljammer , roll again at the same odds to see if it is fired upon again that round; continue to roll until the attack fails when greater than the required percentage is rolled. For cases of large-scale combat with a combined fleet attacking the Spelljammer , the DM may set a maximum number of attacks at 10 shots per round.
    Determine the type of attack using the following table. The DM may also use weapons belonging to disparate factions within the Spelljammer .
    The ships under attack can easily identify which tower launched the assault and thus return fire if they so desire. The DM may identify one of the towers in range for the assault. If the player characters choose to return the Spelljammer 's fire, they will likely find the inhabitants of that tower less than friendly once they arrive.
    The Wake of the Spelljammer:
    The greatest danger to other ships' crews when near the Spelljammer is the possibility of falling into the great ship's gravity plane as it passes. The fact that the Spelljammer can turn and maneuver very swiftly makes it all the more dangerous in the far reaches of space.
    When the Spelljammer enters a hex occupied by another ship, that ship's spelljamming character must make a Dexterity check to remain on the same gravity plane and to resist any damage. The spelljamming mage or priest receives a bonus or penalty to his die roll according to the maneuver rating of his ship as in the following table.
    Failure to succeed on this check results in the same effects as being on a ship without a spelljamming helm. Ships without standard spelljamming helms (including the illithid pools and the beholder orbs) as well as those with helms whose spelljamming wizard has failed the Dexterity check will immediately suffer 1-10 points of hull damage and take a critical hit.
    Those on board must make an additional Dexterity check or fall toward the Spelljammer (quite likely from a high of 20-120 feet) unless caught or otherwise restrained. A saving throw against death by the helmsman (regardless of the type of helm) will prevent the ship from crashing onto the deck of the Spelljammer . (Crashes are handled as per page 65 of the Concordance_of_Arcane_Space in the original SPELLJAMMER® boxed set.)
    The required checks and saving throws can be eliminated in part by always approaching the Spelljammer (or any large object in space, for that matter) along its gravity plane. This should protect the craft from sudden changes in course. The exception is when the Spelljammer makes a 120-degree (two hexside) turn in one round, in which case a new check must be made for craft affected during that round.
    Most veteran captains are aware of this maneuvering procedure, but many new to space are not, and they must learn this procedure through trial and error - and quickly!
    Ramming:
    There are very few things in the universe that the Spelljammer could actually ram. Most ships are of such small size that they would either be swept aside (in the wake attack) or be forced to land on the Spelljammer itself in order to weather the "storm." Items much larger than the Spelljammer will retain large air envelopes, and the Spelljammer will avoid assaulting them closely.
    However, if the captain of the Spelljammer decides to ram a large object or creature, the chitinous lobes at the bow of the Spelljammer are considered blunt_rams for ships of less than 100 tons and as piercing_rams for those of 100 tons or more (including citadels and armadas).
    Furthermore, the Spelljammer will inflict a random number of hull points due to its great size, making an exact strike difficult. Roll d100. The attack will deliver 1-100 hull points of damage times the Spelljammer 's current speed, and it will automatically inflict a number of critical hits to the ship equal to the Spelljammer 's current speed. At the option of the captain, the ship can deliver only the critical hits and not the hull point damage.
    The Spelljammer will not ram unless ordered to by its captain. Its passing through another hex that contains other ships should be considered a wake attack and not ramming.
    Critical Hits:
    The Spelljammer is so large that it does not suffer critical hits. Its towers, however, can still be destroyed, and a critical hit directed against a tower can remove a large weapon.
    Morale and the Spelljammer:
    Although the Spelljammer has no real "crew" with which to engage in combat, the races that live in the towers on its deck would be more than happy to fight the ship's opponents. Each of the creatures in the towers has a morale as stated in its entry, which is used for determining both melee combat and the effects of being attacked. When figuring modifiers for combat between ships and the various towers, the tower weapons may be considered as a separate crew of the ship for purposes of determining morale.
    Magic Against the Spelljammer:
    The Spelljammer is a living thing, and it has magic resistance, high saving throws, and outright immunity to a number of spells.
    For instance, the Spelljammer is immune to all enchantment/charm magics and cannot be commanded, charmed, or otherwise affected by spells from that school or spells that make use of components from that school. In addition, the Spelljammer cannot be fooled by illusions of any type, for it functions as a gem of true seeing for detecting objects around it. Both of these abilities are passed on to its captain through possession of the ultimate helm. (Note that this makes the captain immune to the Spelljammer 's own enchanted air envelope, but the link between captain and ship compensates for this. The Spelljammer prefers its captains to have free wills.)
    Spells directed against the ship can inflict damage, provided they overcome the ship’s magic resistance and the ship fails its saving throw. Parts of the ship protected by this high resistance include all the towers and the hull of the ship. This magical protection continues only as long as the ship is intact - pieces of the ship that are broken off do not retain any magic resistance.
    Certain spells that affect only one creature may be used against the Spelljammer . However, the range of these spells must take the entire Spelljammer into account in order to affect it. Therefore, a temporal stasis would function only if the entire ship could fit into the spellcaster's range.
    Gates , teleports , dimension doors , and other long distance motion spells do not function inside the air envelope because of a side effect produced by the magic that tinges the air. Crystal balls and scrying spells cannot pierce the ship’s air envelope either, and their attempts reveal only a shining blue fog.
    Wishes and limited wishes , as well as related magic obtained from the direct involvement of the gods (including commune and contact other plane), will not function if used directly against the Spelljammer . Characters cannot wish the ship away: the gods will not listen. Characters can use such magics on the Spelljammer for other uses (such as to wish up a magic item to save one's hide in a situation), however, but they cannot use them against the ship.
    All spells function normally on the Spelljammer given the restrictions outlined above. For instance, detect magic , in addition to functioning normally will reveal a light blue, shining fog swirling throughout the ship - the magical fragrances that influence the inhabitants of the Spelljammer .
    The Spelljammer and Repair:
    It is unlikely that the Spelljammer will be severely damaged by anyone or anything, but in the world of adventurers and heroes, the unlikely often becomes a sure thing. Thus the Spelljammer is able to heal itself in times of need.
    The Spelljammer is made of two types of material, the first being the resilient, leathery material of its main hull and the second being the more brittle, chitinous material of its upper towers and ram. Damage done to the towers and ram is akin to damaging the hair or nails of a living thing - a bother but inflicting no permanent damage. (On an additional note, the inhabitants of the towers often break through the walls in order to put in new doors or to expand their domains, with no harm to the Spelljammer .)
    However, the hull itself can be damaged; it has an armor rating of 5. This leathery material can heal naturally at a fairly slow rate of 1-10 points per day. In cases of severe damage (more than 10% or a similar amount delivered to a single location), the shivaks are mobilized. Necromantic spells that heal (or harm) the Spelljammer have no effect on the ship because of its innate magic resistance, but the spells can affect the ship's captain.
    The Spelljammer 's Awareness:
    As stated previously, the Spelljammer is a sentient being, but its awareness is completely alien when compared with the myriad races of known space.
    The Spelljammer has no "eyes" in the standard sense, but it can nevertheless detect life (as per the spell). This detection ability functions throughout whichever crystal sphere the Spelljammer is at when it is at rest, and the ability is always in operation concerning the ship's internal life.
    The Spelljammer 's ability to detect life can key on certain particular life-forms, so that it (and its captain) can know where an individual is at all times. The captain must ask the Spelljammer for this information as the Spelljammer will not volunteer it. While the location of an individual can be determined by this ability, the ship cannot detect what that individual is doing without the use of the shivaks. The shivaks, in effect, act as the "eyes" of the Spelljammer .
    The detect life ability has a drawback in that it cannot detect undead or other unliving creatures, including clockwork horrors and golems. The shivaks also cannot detect or even fight these creatures. It is believed that this inability is the reason why the Spelljammer maintains a large community of living beings on board, who will fight depredations from such unliving creatures in the ship's stead.

    Summary: |
    The Squid Ship is a spelljamming ship built by humans and used by humans and lizard_men .
    Description: |
    The Squid Ship (officially the Cephalopod-class Brig, although even most scholars refer to it by its more common name) is widely considered to be one of the best human ship designs in space . Many scholars believe that the original design for the Squid Ship was created by revolting prisoners of an illithid slave-world, who fused together elements of sea ships and illithid designs. The truth behind this tale is unknown, but it is widely believed. The simplicity of handling which the Squid Ship provides, combined with good armour and weaponry, make it one of the most popular vessels in its size class.
    Crew: |
    The Squid Ship's simple design allows a relatively small crew to handle the rigging and maneuvering. The captain is usually found on the aft deck, where he gets a good view of the rest of the ship. The helm is located below the captain's station, and communication is often achieved with the use of a simple speaking tube. Typical positions aboard a human Squid Ship include a captain, first officer, helmsman, and navigator. A weaponmaster is often included as well, to command the weapon crews. Lizard man crews tend to include a captain and a shaman for a spelljammer, while other positions will be filled as needed by whomever is available.
    Ship Uses:
    Trader: The bulk of Squid Ships are free traders, privately owned vessels that travel from planet to planet, speculating on goods in an attempt to gain the greatest profit possible. A trader usually has a core crew of 12-20, although captains often hire extra hands when travelling through areas of space where combat is likely.
    Piracy: Squid Ships are a favorite choice for reavers, pirates who roam far from any base, looking for easy plunder. The crew of such a ship will usually number 25-35 men, allowing the Squid Ship to lie in wait for prey ships for a long time. Pirate Squid Ships usually carry at least one spell-caster in addition to the helmsman. This extra spell-user is usually of lower level than the helmsman, and will support the crew in battle (often being placed in dangerous situations).
    Military: The simple design and size of the Squid Ship makes it a common choice for human space navies. The Squid Ship is a good, versatile military ship, able to handle patrol, attack, and defensive duties equally well. Military Squid Ships will often upgrade their ballistas to the heavy variety, and will sometimes carry additional weaponry in the forecastle. When operating close to a base, it is not uncommon for a military Squid Ship to carry extra marines for use in boarding actions.
    Free Adventuring: The size of the Squid Ship, along with its ability to land on water, makes it ideal for adventurers exploring newly-discovered worlds (and bringing back the more profitable parts of them). These versions are often modified for better armour, or for more maneuverability, depending on the temperaments of the users.
    Other Configurations:
    Alternate Ram: Pirates and others preferring boarding actions to ship-to-ship combat often replace the distinctive piercing_ram of the Squid Ship with a grappling_ram . These vessels usually carry a full complement of marines.
    Lizard Man Incubators: Prior to the introduction of the Bloatfly , lizard men tribes preferred the Squid Ship for use as an incubator for their eggs. Many of these Incubators have yet to be replaced by Bloatflies, and can still be found in close orbit around fire bodies to ensure that the carried eggs are properly warmed, producing stronger, more intelligent offspring. These ships have a flooded cargo deck, in which various plants and algae grow, both to replenish the air envelope and to provide the proper environment for the eggs.

    Summary: |
    The Stoneship is a spelljamming ship built and used by the xorn .
    Description: |
    These rare ships are simply nearly-solid asteroids fitted with weapons and used by spacegoing xorn on their rare and mysterious forays into space . Stoneships do not truly have blunt_rams built on them, but rather the virtually solid stone ship itself can serve as a blunt ram. Sages generally believe that these spacegoing xorn are searching for a perfect world to colonize. Since Stoneships are the perfect size for smaller dwarven citadels , the asteroids are sometimes boarded by dwarves with the intent of converting them. Since the Stoneship generally appears to simply be a lifeless asteroid, often the dwarves are unaware that it is already inhabited until the xorn start attacking. This of course leads to a vicious, protracted battle that can last for months or years before either the dwarves or the xorn are exterminated.
    Stoneships are powered by fire elementals harnessed through unknown magics that other races have yet to discover. In fact, the xorn are incredibly secretive about this power source, to the extent that they will power down and banish all apparatus and traces of its use whenever intruders are detected aboard a Stoneship. This power source is always enclosed in sealed, interior caverns with no access tunnels. Xorn phase into and out of such caverns at will but other races, even those able to take gaseous form, are unable to enter without powerful magic or extensive digging. Because these caverns are completely airtight, it seems to be possible to use this power source even in the_phlogiston where the fire elementals would normally explode. On at least one occasion a Stoneship in the flow was boarded by dwarves. The xorn seem to have been worried that the dwarves may discover the source of their power, and, being unable to banish the elementals back to their home plane, created a fissure in the stone, exposing the elementals to the phlogiston, and causing a massive explosion which destroyed all traces of the power source.
    Crew: |
    The crew sizes given above are estimates based on human-sized crews. It is believed that only 8 xorn are needed to operate a Stoneship, and 2 per heavy weapon, while a typical crew will number approximately 40.
    Ship Uses:
    Explorer: It is not known for certain if this is the use to which the xorn put their Stoneships, but to all appearances this is their function. They have certainly not been seen to function in any other roles.
    Other Configurations:
    No other configurations of Stoneships are known, unless those captured by dwarves and partially converted into Citadels are counted.

    Summary: |
    The Swan Ship is a spelljamming ship built by halflings and used by halflings, humans , and elves .
    Description: |
    The most successful ship designed by halflings has been the Swan Ship, one of the rare non-elven ship designs which has been deemed acceptable by elves and purchased for inclusion in their navies. The halfling communities that build Swan Ships are usually closely linked with elven communities, which perhaps is why they were able to build a ship that the elves found so appealing.
    Crew: |
    The crew sizes given above are for human-sized crews. Halflings and other small-sized creatures have a crew minimum of 30, and a maximum of 100. Most Swan Ships operated by humans or elves tend to run with a crew of about 30, while halfling crews tend to number about 50. The organization of human crews varies widely, while elves arrange their crews along normal military lines. Those Swan Ships operated by halflings tend to be crewed by a single extended family, with the patriarch or matriarch serving as the nominal captain. Such family-run ships do not have officers or crew per se, rather every family member knows his or her place and cooperates with the rest of the family members.
    Ship Uses:
    Trader/Supply Ship: The Swan Ship makes a graceful and sturdy merchant vessel capable of crashlanding on grasslands or beaches and remaining spaceworthy. Although poorly-armoured for any combat duties, the Swan Ship is relatively maneuverable, and carries enough weaponry to discourage many opponents. Most importantly, the Swan Ship is able to carry significantly more cargo than most ships its size. Almost all human and halfling-operated Swan Ships are traders, while most elven-operated vessels serve the similar role of supply ships for the Imperial Elven Navy.
    Other Configurations:
    Warswan: Many Swan Ships have been modified for combat use, although each such ship seems to be different. The most common modification is simply to add more weapons, although the exact nature of these weapons varies widely. One particularly striking modification to the weaponry involves replacing the ballista on the bridge deck with a greek_fire_projector . When fired, it appears that flames are shooting from the swan's eyes. Although the biggest drawback to a Warswan is its lack of armour, increasing the armour on the ship is not a popular modification, since it usually results in a reduction of the maneuverability which can often save a heavily-armed Warswan in battle.

    Summary: |
    The Thoric Tradesman (or Thoric Trader ) is a spelljamming ship built and used by humans .
    Description: |
    The Thoric Trader is an incredibly unusual ship design, which has yet to appear outside of Clusterspace . A clumsy ship which seems ill-suited to spacefaring, the strange layout of the Thoric Trader, with three identical "propulsion units" arranged in a triangle around a central cargo box, is dictated by the unique helm design of the craft. Thoric ship builders have discovered a way to arrange several spelljamming_helms in order to use the energies from all of them. Dubbed an "arc helm" by the Thoric designers, it seems that this arrangement can be performed with either major or minor helms, and cannot be done on any ship design other than the Thoric Trader. While this means that three helmsmen must be used at once, it allows the Thoric Trader to travel at impressive speeds. The main helm provides full SR , while the two supplementary helms each provide 1/2 of their normal SR (rounded up). This also results in increased velocity when at spelljamming speeds, such that a Thoric Trader with 3 helmsmen will travel at double normal spelljamming speed. If only one helm is manned, the Thoric Trader will travel as any normal ship. Interestingly, the ship will not function at all if two of the helms are used without a helmsman on the third helm. The other interesting feature of the Thoric Trader is its detachable cargo box, which allows these ships to pick up and drop off cargo very quickly in port.
    Crew: |
    Typically operating with 15-20 men, Thoric Traders are notable in that they usually carry a total of 6 helmsmen, allowing the ship to be operated at full speed 24 hours a day.
    Ship Uses:
    Fast Trader: Incredibly ill-suited to combat, the specialized Thoric Trader is really only good at one thing: transporting cargo more quickly than any of her competitors. It should be noted that the Thoric Trader is very expensive to operate, with the result that it is only economical to use the ship on runs in which time is of the essence. The clumsy, lightly-armed Thoric Trader would be easy pickings for pirates were it not for the fact that the vessel is usually able to outrun any hostile ships.
    Other Configurations:
    The precarious arrangement of helms that is found aboard the Thoric Trader seems to restrict any major modifications to the ship, although alternate weapons are not unheard of.

    Summary: |
    The Thorn Ship is a spelljamming ship built and used by thri-kreen .
    Description: |
    The thri-kreen Thorn-ship is a light combat craft intended to serve as a screening vessel for the larger Leaf-ship . Each Leaf-ship always carries 4 Thorn-ships, unless it has lost one or more in combat. Like the Leaf-ship, the Thorn-ship is grown from living crystal, and is constructed with an integral spelljamming device known as a crystal throne. This crystal throne functions as the crystal throne of the Leaf-ship in all respects, aside from the different SR that it provides.
    The tiny Thorn-ship is little more than a powered platform for its weaponry, which is significantly more than could normally be mounted on such a small ship. This heavy firepower is achieved by building the greek_fire_projector into the very hull of the craft as it is grown. Even so, the Thorn-ship cannot properly support all of its weaponry, and is very limited in the amount of ammunition it can carry. Typically a Thorn-ship will carry a standard amount of ammunition for the ballista , but only a single charge of greek fire. In part this is because a Thorn-ship will typically not carry enough crew to operate the greek fire projector at peak efficiency anyway, so it is generally used as a single-shot weapon. In some cases, however, the situation will be reversed, and the Thorn-ship will carry only a single ballista bolt, but up to 10 charges of greek fire. This is usually only done when the ship will be used as a suicide weapon.
    Crew: |
    A Thorn-ship will typically be crewed by 3 thri-kreen. One of these sits on the crystal throne and serves as the pilot, one mans the light ballista, and the third mans the greek fire projector. Since the Thorn-ship is usually only used for short-range support and screening of Leaf-ships, this overloading of the vessel's air envelope is not seen as a problem.
    Ship Uses:
    Screening Vessel: It is virtually unheard of for a Thorn-ship to be used as anything other than a screening vessel for its parent Leaf-ship. In this role, the Thorn-ship provides combat support for the Leaf-ship as needed, and generally serves to protect the Leaf-ship. In some cases this may include short-range scouting and courier missions to keep the Leaf-ship from being put at risk. These short-range missions are always performed within visual distance of the Leaf-ship so that the parent vessel will be aware of any misfortunes which may befall the Thorn-ship, and act appropriately. Sometimes Thorn-ships will be used to crash into enemy vessels while carrying quantities of greek fire. This is only done in cases when the parent Leaf-ship is unlikely to survive the combat otherwise.
    Other Configurations:
    Thri-kreen modify their vessels only under extreme circumstances, and as a result there are no other significant configurations for the Thorn-ship.

    Summary: |
    The Tradesman is a spelljamming ship built by humans and used by most spacefaring races.
    Description: |
    The standard Tradesman is the most common ship in civilized space , varying little throughout the spheres . It is used by humans, lizard_men , elves , dwarves , halflings , goblinkin, gnomes , and even mind_flayers (under duress). The Tradesman is a common short-range merchant ship, plying its way between its ports-of-call, and not equipped to deal with much more than a similarly-equipped vessel that has turned pirate. The performance of the Tradesman is mediocre at best, and the only reason it has become such a popular vessel is its simplicity (which allows it to be easily built at many different ports, as well as allowing crews with little or no training to handle it), and the fact that its cargo bays and cavernous steerage deck allow it to carry more cargo than most ships its size.
    Crew: |
    A typical Tradesman is operated by a singe captain. If the ship is a free trader, the captain is also the owner, however there are collections of guildsmen and combined business interests, called trading costers, who own fleets of Tradesmen. In these trading costers each ship's captain is both partial owner of his ship and of the whole fleet. Trading costers have the advantage of strength through numbers. They can minimize the loss of a particular ship because they have so many. Costers vary from locale to locale, but all Tradesmen owned by a particular coster fly similar colours. Often groups of coster Tradesmen will be encountered, carrying merchandise across space in a caravan - if the profit is high enough. Crew assignments on a Tradesman vary from ship to ship and from race to race. Lizard man ships are arranged along typically slapdash lines, while elven ships adhere to a strict chain of command that (to human minds) often borders on the effete and ludicrous. Humans make do with a captain, helmsman, first officer, and pilot, with other positions filled as needed.
    Ship Uses:
    Trading: The vast majority of Tradesmen are used as traders, keeping asteroid-based civilizations supplied, transporting bulk valuables, and even transporting passengers. Most Tradesmen operate on a single trade route over and over, typically staying within a single sphere.
    Free Adventuring: The Tradesman is often the first spelljamming ship for bands of adventurers, although this is more because of the fact that it is common and readily available rather than because of any suitability for the task. Adventurers who are successful usually upgrade to a more suitable ship as soon as possible. The chain of command aboard an adventuring ship usually sops after captain - which in adventuring terms usually means "the one who yells the loudest."
    Piracy: The common nature of the Tradesman also makes it a vessel for pirates new to the trade, again before they "trade up" to a more suitable craft. When using a Tradesman the pirate's best targets are other Tradesmen and groundling ships. The only advantage that a pirate Tradesman has is that most potential targets would not consider a Tradesman to be a threat, and will not expect an attack.
    Other Configurations:
    Light Cruiser: A Tradesman variant preferred by pirates and those plagued by pirates, the Light Cruiser is plated, increasing AR to 4, but reducing MC to E. Tradesman Light Cruisers typically carry 3 medium ballistas or catapults , reducing cargo capacity to 15 tons.

    Summary: |
    The Triop is a spelljamming ship built by the arcane and used by various spacefaring races.
    Description: |
    The Triop is a relatively new ship to the spheres , but it has proven to be an opponent even the elven captains do not wish to engage. Its hard, chitinous shell is extremely difficult to penetrate. The ship has a few small open decks, but the weapons that protrude from these openings limit the amount of walking space.
    The maneuvering fins of the Triop, often known as 'flip-fins', are capable of extremely rapid movements, which give the Triops some unique maneuvering characteristics. First, these fins can be rapidly jerked in order to increase or decrease the Triop's SR (even above the normal maximum allowed based on the helmsman) by 2 points for a single round. This ability can be used once every 4 rounds, and can only be safely used on a round in which the Triop travels in a straight line. If any attempt is made to turn in the same round that the SR is increased or decreased in this manner, the stresses will cause the Triop to spin wildly out of control, causing the vessel to face a random direction, and suffer both a Ship Shaken and Maneuverability Loss critical hit, as the Triop's fins are damaged. A Triop can also manipulate its fins to spin and face any direction, but only at the expense of 2 SR points. Only one of these two special maneuvers can be performed in any single 4-round period. If an attempt is made to make a second maneuver before the fins have properly recovered from a previous maneuver, then the fins will be damaged with an automatic Maneuverability Loss critical hit. It should be noted that a Maneuverability Loss critical hit from any source will damage the fins, preventing the Triop from performing any special maneuvers until the vessel is repaired.
    The Triop's blunt_ram is not a separate structure like most rams , but is instead made up of the entire frontal carapace of the vessel. This not only gives the ship a 45' wide ram, but it also braces the ship so well, and makes the ram so sturdy that it effectively acts as a bumper. This effectively reduces by 50% any damage that the Triop might otherwise suffer while inflicting a ram attack on an enemy ship.
    Crew: |
    Since the arcane sell Triops to many different races, the crew of the ship naturally varies greatly. Gnolls , goblins , and their kin tend to operate Triops with large crews which approach the maximum that can be safely supported by the air envelope. These crews are organized along standard tribal lines, with the females and children performing maintenance and housekeeping duties, the shamans performing as spelljammers (on those ships equipped with major or minor helms), and with the male warriors operating the ship and weapons, and fighting in any boarding actions. An illithid crew will be organized along the same lines as the crew of a Nautiloid ; however such a ship will typically be equipped with a lifejammer helm rather than a series helm, and as a result more slaves will be carried to power the helm. Human crews tend to be heavy on warriors, but otherwise are very variable in organization.
    Ship Uses:
    Military: Most Triops operated by humans can be found serving in militaries. These vessels are used in the role of medium or heavy warships. While their ranged weaponry is relatively light, their maneuverability and powerful rams make up for this in the eyes of many commanders.
    Reaver: Triops operated by goblins, gnolls, or related species serve as reavers, attacking any ships that they think they can take on, and plundering wherever possible. These ships are usually clanships, carrying females and children as well as warriors. Typical tactics include using the Triop's unique maneuverability to make sudden, devastating ram attacks, smashing a target to pieces. Once the target has broken up, the reavers salvage whatever they can from the debris, including slaves. Some human pirates operate Triops in a similar fashion, but this is uncommon, since human pirates tend to prefer to use vessels that allow them to take prizes intact.
    Slaver: Illithid crews use Triops because the enclosed nature of the craft appeals greatly to their natures. When using a Triop, illithids are not usually actively hunting for more slaves, but are rather securely transporting slaves from one location to another; often taking slaves to be sold, or returning to an illithid base after purchasing new slaves.
    Other Configurations:
    Heavy Weapons: The only common modification of the Triop that has yet appeared is a Heavy Weapons Triop. This ship simply replaces the light ballistas and catapults with heavy versions. This ship loses 12 tons of cargo capacity, but its heavy attack capability takes many by surprise.

    Summary: |
    The Tsunami is a spelljamming ship built and used by the humans of Wa .
    Description: |
    These monstrous ships are amongst the most powerful vessels found in Realmspace , greatly outclassing such traditional heavy warships as Armadas or Deathspiders . The Tsunami is shaped as a monstrous, articulated metal centipede, winding gracefully through space . It is said that seeing a Tsunami turning in space is one of the most beautiful things to witness, but seeing it turning against you is the most terrifying. While the Tsunami is well-armed with standard weaponry, its primary method of attack is to unleash a "plague" of Locust ships to attack enemy craft. Above each of the Tsunami's legs is a hatch leading to a small cargo bay. These bays are also used as landing bays for the Locusts carried. Depending on the ship, the current mission, and the availability of Locusts, a Tsunami may carry anywhere from 20-80 Locusts (although carrying more than 40 is rare), each of which takes up 1 ton of cargo space. A Tsunami could theoretically carry 100 Locusts, but only for an incredibly short distance, since this would reduce cargo capacity to nil, allowing no food or water to be carried.
    Every other segment of the Tsunami has an open deck on which weaponry is mounted. The tail end of the ship has two long appendages which are used to take a derelict ship in tow. The front of the ship mounts a pair of Antennae of Triangulation , enhancing the ship's ability to detect enemy ships. The legs of the Tsunami can be used to "walk" the craft while it is on the ground, as long as the ship's helm is manned. This ability is rarely needed. Along the spine of the ship are numerous gardens, lit by lanterns on poles enchanted with Continual Light spells. These gardens are decorative, but also freshen the ship's air envelope.
    The Tsunami was designed and built in the last decade. When Wa discovered the presence of Shou_Lung ships in space, they became fearful that the Shou had gained an advantage that could lead to Wa's ultimate destruction. They sent waves of spies to steal any Shou secrets about space travel. When they discovered the existence of the powerful elven fleets, they became even more fearful. This paranoia led Wa to to create their own space fleet. At first this consisted of Junks powered by traditional major and minor helms, but the aggressive Wa fleet quickly came into conflict with the Imperial Elven Navy, and most of these Junks were lost, and their expensive helms captured. In order to avoid this, Wa developed the ki-helm, which would be useless to the elves, and the massive Tsunami, which was intended to be impossible to defeat.
    The Tsunami was largely inspired by the elven Armadas which inflicted such damage to Wa's first space fleet. The carried Locusts were intended to match the elven Flitters , while the Tsunami itself was intended to out-maneuver the elven ships which rely so heavily on their maneuverability. When the first Tsunami engaged in battle with an elven Armada the battle lasted nearly a day, but the Tsunami and its Locusts were ultimately the victors. A total of 8 Tsunamis have been built to date, and more are unlikely since the expensive craft have already nearly bankrupted Wa.
    Crew: |
    The air-freshening gardens on the back of a Tsunami allow the ship to carry 300 men without straining the air envelope. This allows enough men to operate the ship itself and its weapons, and still leaves 100 men to pilot Locusts, or perform other duties. In times of war, however, a Tsunami will usually carry closer to 400 men. The hierarchy aboard a Tsunami is incredibly rigid, and is followed strictly. Any dissention is usually dealt with via execution or "volunteering" for a suicide mission. The most important thing to the officers and crew aboard a Tsunami is honour and prestige. Each ship carries one admiral and three captains. One captain is in control of the crew who operate the craft, one is in control of the weapons teams and boarding parties, and the third captain is in control of the assault teams who operate the Locusts.
    Ship Uses:
    Military: This massively expensive ship is only used as a military vessel, and it carries the prestige and honour of Wa in space.
    Other Configurations:
    The Tsunami is so strictly regulated that no modifications of any sort are allowed by the admiralty of Wa.

    Summary: |
    The Turtle Ship is a spelljamming ship built by lizard_men and used by lizard men, humans , and illithids .
    Description: |
    A rugged scalykind trader-ship design popular with humans (especially pirates and free-traders who run dangerous routes and fight often), Turtle Ships have a distinctive shape and appearance. A recent design, and possibly the best one yet devised by lizardmen, they are now beginning to appear in numbers. Mind flayers have been quick to seize Turtle Ships, turning them to slaving uses.
    Crew: |
    An average lizardman crew is 26. The captain will be a powerful warrior, usually of 9th level or higher, and at least 16 of the crew are veteran warriors of 3rd level. There are also at least 2 shamans. These shamans may serve as spelljammers, or a human mage may be hired to serve in this capacity. Humans tend to use similar crew arrangements, while illithid crews tend to be organized along the same lines as the crew of a Nautiloid .
    Ship Uses:
    Trader: Turtle Ships used as traders are not cheap, but have good cargo capacity, and are well-protected against pirates. The inside of a lizardman trader is dank and dark, dominated by a central pool on the cargo deck, although human crews will generally run a ship which is drier and more well-lit.
    Warship: Lizardmen now primarily use the Turtle Ship as a combat vessel, exploring dangerous sectors of space , escorting traders, and defending major scalykind colonies. These ships often mount heavier weaponry, frequently 3 heavy ballistas and 1 heavy catapult . These powerful ships typically travel in twos and threes in order to ensure that such a ship doesn't fall into the hands of an enemy.
    Slaver: Mind flayers use the heavily armoured and enclosed Turtle Ship as a slaving craft, fitting the cargo deck out as a massive slave pen filled with manacles and cages. The helm is often replaced with a series helm.
    Other Configurations:
    Heavy Turtle: Some Turtle Ships used as warships have been modified as Heavy Turtles. These ships invariably mount all heavy weapons, and have their hulls thickened and fitted with extra plating. The resulting ship has an impressive AR 1, but cargo space is reduced to 11 tons, and the maneuverability class is reduced to E. Despite these disadvantages, the Heavy Turtle is a powerful ship, which is nearly invulnerable to damage.
    Dragonturtle: A few Turtle Ships have been modified by humans of Shou_Lung . These ships have been stripped to make room for more cabins, reducing the AR to 5, and a superstructure has been added to the prow, much the same as that found on a Dragonship , although strengthened to allow it to serve as a blunt_ram . The interiors of these vessels have been entirely rebuilt to serve the purposes of the Shou captains, most of whom have been powerful wu jen.

    Summary: |
    The Tyrant Ship is a spelljamming ship built by the arcane and used by beholders .
    Description: |
    Tyrant Ships are the most diverse class of ships in fantasy space. They can look like walnut shells, huge eyeballs, shells carried by squidlike tentacles - even huge beholders. The above stats apply to a "typical" Tyrant Ship, but larger or smaller ships are not uncommon. The individuality of the Tyrant Ship reflects the individual nature of the beholder races. While all beholders share the same basic form and abilities, their genetic lines are plastic, such that small regional differences lead to radical differences in appearance. Since each beholder considers its own type to be the racial ideal, and all others to be nothing more than mutants to be eliminated from the gene pool, a similar view is taken in their ship designs. Tyrant Ships are designed to different specifications by the Arcane for each different beholder racial type, although they all share the same basic structure - a concave "shell" indented with small pockets to serve as resting places for individual beholders with their tentacles down. At the centre of the bowl rests the ship's hive_mother , surrounded by a number of orbi .
    Tyrant Ships usually lack conventional weapons, but make up for it with one of the most terrifying weapons in space : the combined force of a large number of beholders in a single place. A "beholder circuit" of common beholders and a queen can provide a beam of magical energy about 400 yards (1 hex) long and up to 100 yards across at the base. This beam can have a number of different effects, based on a beholder's natural magical ability:
    Charm Person - One target per common beholder in the circuit. Targets do not need to be grouped together, although all must be within the beam's area of effect. Any one target need only save once per round this effect is used.
    Charm Monster - As Charm Person .
    Sleep - For each common beholder in the circuit, a target may be affected. The intensity of the magical sleep is not increased, nor may one target be affected by multiple sleep attacks in one round.
    Telekinesis - Add 250 lbs. to the normal capacity for every additional common beholder in the circuit.
    Flesh to Stone - One target for each common beholder in the circuit. All targets must be within a 10' radius.
    Disintegrate - Each common beholder in the circuit after the first increases the area of effect as if an additional Disintegrate was cast.
    Fear - One target can be affected for each common beholder in the circuit. These targets can be anywhere within the beam's area of effect, and can be chosen by the individual beholders, although a target cannot be required to make more than one save per round.
    Slow - One target can be affected for every common beholder in the circuit. If the spelljammer is exposed to the beam and affected, the SR of the ship will be reduced.
    Cause Serious Wounds - One target can be affected for each common beholder in the circuit. Multiple attacks can be made on the same target in the same round.
    Death Ray - One target can be affected for every common beholder in the circuit, but all such targets must be within a 10' radius.
    Anti-Magic Ray - The most deadly of the beholders' arsenal of attacks in space, this ray affects everything within the target area. Should the ship's helm be exposed (upper decks will provide sufficient cover to prevent this, but the Disintegrate power may be used first to remove this cover) and affected it will shut down, rendering the ship immobile.
    The key to dealing with aggressive Tyrant Ships is to stay out of range of their magical attacks. Long-range attacks against the ships work best, but even causing a Tyrant Ship to break up has its own problems, since the individual beholders, even without the magic in the hull of the ship which allows them to use a circuit, are highly dangerous, and will swarm an attacking ship if possible, either to destroy it or capture it as a temporary home until they can get a more appropriate ship.
    Crew: |
    The uncontested ruler of a Tyrant Ship is the single hive mother which will be on board, focusing the common beholders in a circuit, and commanding the orbi who power the ship. All of the ship's energies pass through the massive central eye of the queen. The bulk of the crew of a Tyrant Ship is made up of common beholders, but 1-6 orbi will also be carried to provide motive force. The orbi actually provide this force by channelling the power of the common beholders. As long as at least one common beholder is in the circuit, each orbus provides 1 SR to the ship. In some cases various varieties of beholder abominations will also be carried aboard a Tyrant Ship, however this is usually only done when the ship is a part of an invasion force, in which case the abominations will serve as ground troops once the ship arrives at its destination. Since abominations cannot become a part of a beholder circuit, they are considered a liability in space combat, since they displace more useful common beholders and orbi.
    Ship Uses:
    Purification: The beholder nations exist for only one reason: the purification of their race of the scum (i.e. all beholders who differ from themselves in any respect). All other activities - including trading, raiding, piracy and the like - are secondary to this basic goal, and are only pursued if they will somehow advance the goal of purification. The fact that beholders would rather fight amongst themselves than fight the rest of the universe is something that other races are grateful for, although it does give some sages cause to worry.
    Other Configurations:
    Tyrant Rammer: A version of the standard shell with a large piercing_ram modified to fit over the front, the Tyrant Rammer is primarily used against non-beholder ships, and makes boarding actions easy. A Tyrant Rammer is more likely to carry abominations than a more standard Tyrant Ship.
    Combined Race Ships: Most Tyrant Ships have small cargo areas, reserved for food and water. In some cases, beholders have built more elaborate ships with additional cargo and/or living space for allied races. Such relationships remain tense, however, since the beholders generally consider their "allies" to be nothing more than cannon fodder, while the allies help the beholders out of pure fear (unless Charmed ). There have been beholder/ man , beholder/ dwarf , and even reports of beholder/ mind_flayer team-ups. For some unknown reason beholders will never ally with neogi . The most common configuration for ships designed for these team-ups is a Tyrant Ship "shell" mounted to a larger ship.

    Summary: |
    The Unity Ship is a spelljamming ship built and used by the k'r'r'r .
    Description: |
    The Unity Ships are the creation of the deep-space dwelling K'r'r'r. Their ships are great catamarans with three outer decks, and three huge outriggers. Each deck carries a medium ballista at the bow. The gravity plane runs along the length of the ship, but the catamarans provide three downward directions, resulting in a very unusual gravity configuration. Each Unity Ship has three "up" directions, and three "down" directions, and is constructed of three different hulls attached together in a triangular arrangement. This design is bizarre to other races.
    Unity Ships are identical and modular, such that they can link together at the catamarans to form a large ship (all ships occupy the same hex regardless of the eventual size). The binding is a maneuver practiced by the crews until it is second nature to them. Two Unity Ships need only move into the same hex and have crews and helmsmen willing to perform the maneuver in order to link up. The K'r'r'r helmsmen have their minds melded at the time of the linkage, such that the ship has the SR of the slowest member of the meld. Linked Unity Ships cannot achieve spelljamming speeds, but can maneuver at tactical speeds. If 1-3 Unity Ships are linked, there is no penalty to the maneuverability class, but for every 3 ships (or portion thereof) linked together after the first 3, the maneuverability class drops by one. This places the practical maximum for linked Unity Ships at 12, since if any more ships are added the maneuverability class would drop to G, indicating an uncontrolled drifting. Unity Ships which are linked have combined hull points and air envelopes (any damage taken by the unity is equally distributed between the vessels that compose it); however a critical hit affects only one ship in the unity, so any vessel that has its helmsman incapacitated can drop out of the formation. When ramming, the Unity Ships in a linked formation gain +1 to hit for every 2 ships in the unity. For the actual ram attack, however, only a single ship is used, which will drop out of the unity at the last moment (the magical link that keeps the ships together is not strong enough to hold together under the stresses of a ram - similarly if the unity is rammed by an enemy ship, only one Unity Ship will be affected, and it will be knocked out of the formation). Each linked Unity Ship retains its own unusual gravity configuration.
    The linkage between Unity Ships is possible due to the properties of the K'r'r'r helm, which appears as an ivory staff bound in gold, and which functions as a minor_helm in all other respects. Other races can use a K'r'r'r helm (indeed, due to their attractive appearance and the fact that the helmsman can freely move about the ship while using the helm, a K'r'r'r helm usually fetches a significantly higher price on the open market than a minor helm); however they lack the correct mental architecture to unite ships into a unity. Even K'r'r'r helmsmen using K'r'r'r helms can only perform this linkage if the ships used are Unity Ships, and if the crews of those ships are made up entirely of K'r'r'r.
    Crew: |
    The K'r'r'r who crew the Unity Ships are fanatical warriors when led by a war master, who serves as both captain and leader of any assaults. A Unity Ship will typically have two helmsmen; specialized priests with limited access to spells (all, guardian, protection, sun spheres). In addition to these officers and the crew required to maneuver the ship, each Unity Ship typically has a complement of a dozen K'r'r'r warriors who man the ballistas and serve as boarding parties.
    Ship Uses:
    Colonization: Unity Ships have only one purpose: to go out and seize new lands for their empire. The K'r'r'r have a preference for gas worlds, dwarven citadels , and asteroid bases, but any spacial body up to size A is a potential target. Only groundlings are completely safe from K'r'r'r colonization fleets, since the spider-like creatures shun large worlds. Any target of a K'r'r'r unity fleet must be cleansed of non-K'r'r'r life, after which the new owners can settle down to establish their colony and begin building more Unity Ships. The individual vessels of a fleet are launched in a straight line, far enough apart to allow them to go to spelljamming speeds. When a unity fleet is encountered, a new Unity Ship appears each round, from the same direction, and on the same vector as the previous ship, until the entire fleet is assembled. There are usually 4-24 ships in a K'r'r'r fleet. If more than 12 ships are encountered, they will form two separate unities; each with roughly equal numbers of ships. The best tactic for surviving a K'r'r'r attack is to hit them hard as they slow to tactical speed, before they can unite. A linked unity forms a mobile fortress that can easily knock most other ships out of the stars, yet individual ships are far less powerful and more vulnerable to attack. Once the unity has been formed, the best tactic is usually to ram it in order to knock individual ships out of formation, however this is dangerous, since few ships attacking an assembled unity survive long enough to successfully ram it.
    Other Configurations:
    The K'r'r'r intentionally keep all of their Unity Ships identical, since otherwise they would be unable to link. Since the ships are virtually never used by other races, no other configurations are found.

    Summary: |
    The Urchin is a spelljamming ship built and used by neogi .
    Description: |
    The Urchin is the neogi response to the elven Flitter : a light inexpensive craft which can be used either at the tactical level for support, or as an emergency vehicle. It is sometimes fitted with a spelljamming_helm (a lifejammer is the usual choice for this), but it is more often used with a conventional engine, giving it a tactical movement of 1. The Urchin looks like the sea creature that is its namesake; a sphere with multiple spikes jutting from it in all directions. The pilot (along with any victim for the lifejammer, if such a helm is carried) sits in a separate central sphere encased in the spike sphere, weighted at the bottom so that the pilot will remain upright regardless of how the ball moves or rolls.
    The spikes are sharpened to be used as rams against similarly small vessels, or as antipersonnel weapons. If the Urchin is on the ground, or on a ship's deck, it can be used to roll at creatures to impale them. When used in this manner, the Urchin has a movement rate of 12, and can move in any direction like a normal creature (this is regardless of the power source). Attack rolls are made using the pilot's THAC0, but a successful attack indicates that the victim is struck by 1d4 spikes for 1d6+4 points of damage each. If the Urchin is attacked with hand weapons, the attacker must survive 1d4 spike hits in order to attack the body of the craft. Alternatively the attacker can attack the spikes first. Each spike can take 5 hp of damage before being snapped off. Destroying 5 spikes reduces the Urchin's movement rate to 6 and allows one attacker to get at the body of the Urchin without risking assault. Destroying 10 spikes will immobilize the craft, allowing any number of attackers to strike at the body of the Urchin.
    Crew: |
    The Urchin is primarily intended as a one-being vehicle, though 2 medium-sized figures can fit into it. Usually a lone neogi of the absolute lowest status (typically a young creature who has yet to claim a personal umber_hulk slave, and thus has yet to be accepted as an adult member of the neogi community) will be its sole crew. Urchins carrying lifejammers will carry a single "passenger" who will be the helm's victim. Smaller victims are preferred for this, since space within the Urchin is at a premium.
    Ship Uses:
    Close-Assault: The Urchin is used primarily as a close-assault vehicle. Up to 20 of these ships can be carried inside a Deathspider (more commonly such a ship will carry 4-10 Urchins) and strewn like mines in front of other ships. Urchins are most effective against crew of ships with large, open decks, but they can also be deadly to small craft such as Flitters if they are able to ram them (most small craft are able to out-run or out-maneuver the Urchin in order to avoid ram attacks). Enclosed ships, such as the Nautiloid , have little to fear from Urchins.
    Other Configurations:
    Snowflake: Urchins are not infrequently modified to serve as messengers between different groups of neogi. These craft are painted white, and have their spikes capped by bulbous metal or ivory sheaths in order to signify that the ship is not a threat. While the spikes are sheathed, the ship loses its attack capability, but the sheaths may be removed if needed. These ships, referred to as Snowflakes, are typically only used for sending messages over short distances, since the Lifejammer aboard is likely to kill the only available victim after only a single day, leaving the messenger without a source of fuel.
    Gob: Sometimes Urchins are loaded with greek fire and deployed at close range. Once in an enemy's gravity field, they fall onto the vessel, crack open, and ignite; causing damage as two hits from a greek_fire_projector , plus normal crash damage. Such craft are called " Thrig'ki 's Lovers" (an obscure historical reference used and understood only by neogi), or, more commonly, "Gobs" (used by neogi and non-neogi alike). Gobs are usually unpiloted and simply allowed to drift towards the enemy, but sometimes a charmed slave will be crammed in with the greek fire, and the Gob will move as a normal depowered Urchin. Gobs pose nearly as great a threat to the Deathspider carrying them as they do to the enemy, since a critical hit may ignite them while they are still aboard. Only a neogi captain who has offended his fleet owner will be ordered to carry them.

    Summary: |
    The Uspo is a spelljamming ship built and used by the dohwar .
    Description: |
    The Uspo is shaped like a huge penguin lying on its stomach. Its massive wings are movable, and are deployed perpendicular to the body during planet landings. Theoretically the wings are supposed to make the ship more maneuverable, but this works poorly in practice. The Uspo has no exposed decks, and the interior can only be reached from the hinged beak. This is intended as a defensive measure. Since the dohwar prefer never to fight, there is no need for the ship to have open decks and weapons ports. Similarly, it is easier for the hired mercenaries of the dohwar to defend them from any boarders if there is only one potential point of access for those boarders.
    Crew: |
    An Uspo will rarely carry more than 40 dohwar, and will more typically have about 20 of the creatures on board. Four to eight of these dohwar will be merchants, who, in addition to their roles in trade, serve as officers. The leaders of the ship, however, will usually be one or two managers, who serve as commanders, spelljammers, and all-around bosses. Depending on the size of the crew and the importance of the ship, the manager(s) on board may answer directly to an executive board member. If a ship has an executive board member on board, he will be the unquestioned master of the ship. The remainder of the dohwar on board are common salesmen. About half of all Uspos also carry 4d12 giff mercenaries in order to defend the craft. An Uspo without giff mercenaries has a 5% chance of carrying 4d12 "death-squealers" instead - a group of protector dohwar riding space_swine mounts into battle, pouring out the beak of the Uspo in combat situations.
    Ship Uses:
    Trader: Without exception, Uspos are used as trade vessels. These ships carry various and diverse odds and ends of merchandise of all sorts from one port to another, and are willing to sell anything on board to anyone - for a price. The slow, clumsy, and undefended Uspo would seem to be a tempting target for pirates, and in many ways this is true. Really, the only thing that ever makes pirates think twice about attacking an Uspo is the fact that so many of the ships carry large numbers of giff mercenaries. Even with this in mind, Uspos are still popular targets for pirates. This is causing even more Uspos to hire giff mercenaries, however, making the taking of an Uspo more and more dangerous.
    Other Configurations:
    The dohwar seem strangely attached to the design of the Uspo, and have shown a marked reluctance to modify it.

    Summary: |
    The Vagabond is a spelljamming ship built and used by the Aperusa .
    Description: |
    A Vagabond is an assorted collection of parts from other vessels, usually attached to a wooden hull. These ships are asymmetrical nightmares, but they work. Vagabonds are painted in bright, clashing colours, with multi-coloured banners hanging from masts that seem to have no apparent function. Each Vagabond is constructed and maintained by an individual aperusa clan, although depending on the size of the clan two or more ships may be built to serve the clan's needs. Even in cases in which a clan has more than one Vagabond, each ship will be distinctly unique in appearance, although all Vagabonds share approximately the same performance characteristics, and are approximately the same size.
    All Vagabonds are unarmed. The aperusa instead prefer to interact peacefully with other spacefarers when possible, often robbing them blind in the process, and flee from any attackers if needed. If faced with attackers whom they are unable to flee from, the aperusa prefer to handle the situation by summoning a constellate to fight on their behalf. This alarming tendency tends to keep attacks on aperusa Vagabonds low, at least from those who are aware of it. If a determined attacker catches a Vagabond whose patriarch is unable to currently summon a constellate, the Vagabond tends to be easy pickings. If, however, a constellate is summoned, the attacker is virtually always doomed.
    Crew: |
    A Vagabond tends to carry 15-20 aperusa, who will be an extended family group, sometimes being the entirety of a particular clan, and sometimes merely being one family group of several within that clan. Most of the work aboard the ship will be done by the women, while the men give the orders and live in comfort. A crew will typically include 2-4 blades (5th level fighters who also have the spellcasting abilities of 5th level bards, and the thieving abilities of 5th level thieves), and 1-2 umbras (5th level thieves who also have the spellcasting abilities of 5th level bards), while the rest of the aperusa on board can be treated as 1st level thieves. The blades and umbras serve as spelljammers and leaders, although they could not truly be called officers. It should be noted that blades are exclusively male, and very few umbras will be female. A Vagabond may or may not carry the clan's patriarch and/or matriarch (these will be the eldest male and his wife, if any, or the widow of the eldest male), referred to as Beloved Grandfather or Beloved Grandmother respectively. Grandfathers and Grandmothers are treated as blades or umbras, although they are 10th level, and they are the undisputed leaders of the clan.
    Ship Uses:
    Clan Ship: All Vagabonds are used by the aperusa as clan ships, taking their nomadic crews from port to port. These clan ships are the permanent homes of the aperusa, and aid them in the various pursuits by which they make their living, including salvage, and trading the various items which they have salvaged, or purloined through their many scams and schemes. When a clan owns more than one Vagabond, they will travel in a colourful convoy.
    Other Configurations:
    While each Vagabond is unique, they all share similar characteristics, and there are no other significant variations of the ship.

    Summary: |
    The Vipership is a spelljamming ship built by humans and used by humans and goblinkin.
    Description: |
    A refinement of both the Eel and the Lamprey , the Vipership is perhaps the best, and most successful early human spelljammer design. Sleek, maneuverable, and heavily armed, the Vipership has proved to be a deadly vessel for its size class, and they are highly prized by navies and pirates alike. During the First_Unhuman_War , many goblinkin tribes made acquiring Viperships a priority, since they felt that the ships would make a potent weapon against the elves , partly because of its impressive combat abilities, and partly because it would not be attacked on sight. As this trend continued, elves began intercepting and boarding all Viperships that they encountered to ensure that the crews were not goblinkin. This harassment, along with the fact that many goblin-commanded Viperships were destroyed or captured by the elves, led to a decline in the vessel's popularity, and to this day it has remained a relatively uncommon sight. Despite this, it seems that the Vipership is making a comeback. For centuries no new Viperships were built in the known spheres ; however, within the past 30 years a human group dismantled a salvaged Vipership, and began producing new vessels. The plans for the Vipership, lost since the First Unhuman War, have since been sold to several other shipyards. During the Second Unhuman War, it also became apparent that some goblinkin-controlled Viperships escaped the elves centuries ago. Intelligence has determined that at least one hidden hobgoblin shipyard has been steadily building Viperships for nearly 200 years. Evidence suggests that these hobgoblins have built hundreds of Viperships, and have supplied many of these to their scro allies. If the hobgoblins could somehow acquire enough helms to power all of these Viperships, it could tip the balance of the war.
    Crew: |
    Human crews of Viperships tend to be arranged along military lines. Such a crew will typically be 15 strong, which allows the ship and weapons to be manned at full efficiency, while still allowing several replacements for any casualties taken in combat. Amongst humans larger crews are unpopular, even on short journeys, since the Vipership has very little in the way of crew comforts or privacy. This matters little to goblinkin crews, who typically carry a crew of 30 ( goblins or kobolds may cram even more warriors on board).
    Ship Uses:
    Warship: Although very small for a warship, this is the role for which Viperships were designed, and it is a role that they excel at. The Vipership is ideally suited to destroying enemy scouts, providing supporting fire for larger ships in fleet operations, and going head-to-head with other medium and light warships. In addition, Viperships are often used as personal transports for high-ranking officers.
    Reaver: Used by both goblinkin and some human pirates as a reaver, the Vipership is perfect for attacking merchant vessels, and even military supply ships. Vipership reavers usually operate alone, and typically attack with the intent of capturing the other ship as a prize. Because of this, even human pirate crews often carry more than 15 men, in order that a prize crew can be provided for the captured vessel.
    Other Configurations:
    Fireviper: This experimental version is being developed by humans. The Fireviper is fitted with additional armour, giving the ship AR 4 and MC C. Two ballistas and the jettison are replaced with a pair of bombard turrets. The cargo space, now used as a powder magazine, is further armoured (chance of a critical hit igniting the powder is reduced to 6%), reducing cargo space to 4 tons. By necessity, the Fireviper is a short-range military craft, and is intended to serve as a defense boat.

    Summary: |
    The Wasp is a spelljamming ship built by lizard_men and used by lizard men and humans .
    Description: |
    The Wasp is a variant on the theme of the Dragonfly , built to suit the needs of lizard men. One of the first vessels designed and built with the lizard man in mind, the Wasp looks slapdash and poorly engineered. In fact, the Wasp performs adequately if not exceptionally. The lower decks of the central section are bowed outward and flooded for use by the lizard men, and as a storage area for their pets. The raised hump on the wasp's back provides high ground for the ship's main weapon turret, usually a heavy ballista .
    Crew: |
    Lizard men normally have a single captain and a shaman responsible for the splljamming helm (often with one or more apprentices serving as backup helmsmen). Beyond that, tasks are shared without official positions. The weapons teams usually consist of those lizard men closest to the weapons at the time of a battle. In battle the captain is usually stationed either on the foredeck or at the ballista turret, where he can lead by example, while the helm and charts are kept below the foredeck. While there are official "crew quarters" aboard the ship, these are usually reserved for the captain and shaman; the rest of the crew generally bunks down in any available space. Many lizard man ships carry "crew mascots" in the flooded cargo area. These mascots are often schools of fish, such as groupers or small sharks, and are sometimes used to feed the lizard men, or provide a convenient method of disposing of unneeded prisoners. Some ships carry larger creatures, such as octopi, squid, or crocodiles.
    Ship Uses:
    Piracy: The chief use of the Wasp is as a pirate vessel, preying on un-armed or lightly-armed ships. It lacks a ram, but the forward deck makes an excellent boarding platform. The Wasp's size even allows it to land on larger ships.
    Free Adventuring: Many adventurers use the Wasp because it is easily purchased or captured from the lizard men. Despite its size, the Wasp is an impressive-looking ship when it comes to awing untraveled locals.
    Other Configurations:
    Bee Class: This variant is a purely deep space craft used in areas where lizard men have an established off-planet base. The wasp's landing gear is removed and replaced with two additional turrets containing 2 more heavy ballistas. The Bee Class Wasp cannot land on land, although water landings are possible (if uncommon), and the ship's cargo capacity is reduced to 3 tons (removing the landing gear somewhat mitigates the reduction in cargo capacity that would usually be needed as a result of the additional weapons).
    Bumble Bee: This configuration is a massive variant of the Bee in which the legs and the ballista are jettisoned, and the hull itself deepened and widened to carry an additional 6 tons of cargo capacity. The "pregnant" appearance of the Bumble Bee marks it as a trader's vessel and an easy target. In some regions Bee Class Wasps will be disguised as Bumble Bees (either by magic or false fronts) to attract would-be targets.
    Fleet-Footed Wasp: This evasion-minded variant of the Wasp is stripped, reducing AR to 8, but increasing MC to C. In addition, a medium jettison is added in the tail section, taking up 2 tons of cargo space.

    Summary: |
    The Werewolf (or Vodoni Butcher ) is a spelljamming ship built by the Zalani and used by the Vodoni and humans .
    Description: |
    The workhorse of the Vodoni naval forces, the Werewolf is a powerful heavy warship, well suited to the standard tactics used by the Vodoni. The Werewolf, designed and built for the Vodoni by the enslaved Zalani race, appears as a huge, red-winged wolf with open jaws to rip, tear, and grab a hull when ramming. The Werewolf is heavily armoured, and is designed to close with enemy ships as quickly as possible so that targets can be rammed and boarded. During the fall of the Vodoni empire, many Werewolves were captured by the factions involved in the empire's defeat. The elves wanted nothing to do with these ships, since they do not fit with their sense of aesthetics. The dwarves , as ever, prefer their own ships of stone, while the beholders would not deign to use the ships of an inferior race. Few of the treacherous neogi involved in the war survived, and it is believed that those who fled did not capture any Vodoni ships. While the illithids kept a few captured Vodoni craft, the vast majority of those captured during the war made their way into the hands of various human factions, either because the humans captured the ships, or because they were captured by another faction which then sold the ships to the humans. Notably, the human empire of Tyrannous has reverse-engineered the Werewolf with the help of several "liberated" Zalani shipwrights, and has begun to produce new Werewolves for its own navy.
    Crew: |
    When used by the Vodoni, a Werewolf would carry 2-3 breeders (human dual-classed warrior/transmuters) who served as the captain, first officer, and navigator. All breeders on a Vodoni ship also serve as helmsmen and battle-mages as required. Between 20 and 30 normal human sailors would be carried to handle the ship and man the weapons (the typical Vodoni tactic called for the weapons to be loaded before coming within firing distance of the enemy, and then manned by a single sailor who would fire the weapon once before ramming - reloading was considered unnecessary), as well as 20 Vodoni enforcer marines. The enforcers were the true weapon of the Werewolf, and would pour down the boarding ramp in battle, slaughtering the enemy crew. When a Werewolf is operated by non-Vodoni the crew organization will vary greatly. As a general rule, however, the vast majority of Werewolves are operated as military ships, and so they will usually carry between 50 and 60 men, including a significant number of marines.
    Ship Uses:
    Warship: Most Werewolves are used as combat vessels. This is the role that they were intended to fill for the Vodoni, and most captured ships are used in this fashion.
    Reaver: While the Vodoni empire has fallen, a large number of Werewolves remain in Vodoni hands. Without any sort of a command structure for these ships to fit themselves into, most Vodoni-controlled Werewolves have become independent reavers, acting on the sole authority of the commanding breeders. Such ships are highly dangerous, attacking indiscriminately, and taking whatever they want. As no new breeders are trained, and no new enforcers are created, these Vodoni-operated reavers will eventually vanish from the spaceways as attrition takes its toll.
    Cargo Galley: The Vodoni used a significant number of Werewolves as cargo galleys. These ships supported Vodoni forces throughout their empire, and would usually be crewed by a small number of breeders and enforcers controlling a slave crew. After the fall of the Vodoni empire these poorly-manned ships were easily captured, and most have since been converted to warships by those who captured them.
    Other Configurations:
    Warwolf: Some captured Werewolves have been converted by human navies into the version which has become known as the Warwolf. Warwolves add extra armour plating, and thicken the hull. This gives the ship AR 2, but reduces MC to E, and cargo space is reduced to 24 tons. The catapults on a Warwolf are replaced with more heavy ballistas , and often a fourth heavy ballista is mounted on the hull just aft of where the ship's head meets the wings, further reducing cargo space to 20 tons. Warwolves are used in fleet actions as heavy attack ships, and the powerful but clumsy vessels are intended to be supported by more nimble ships.

    Summary: |
    The Whaleship is a spelljamming ship built and used by humans .
    Description: |
    As long as the Hammership , but much taller, with a large number of enclosed decks and a heavy, armoured, blunt_ram in the front, the whale looks like the sea mammal it is named after, a huge sperm_whale . It is not known for being graceful, only big. It is a perfect hauler of large bulk freight and passengers. Its lack of maneuverability and weaponry generally makes it ineffective as a combat craft, but Whales have been used in that capacity in the past. Their greatest advantage is that all of their considerable tonnage is enclosed.
    Crew: |
    In addition to the helmsman and captain, the crew of a Whale consists of oarsmen who man the ship's flippers. Those Whales used as passenger ships usually have these crewmen serving double duty as pursers, cooks, and servants to those on board. It is rare for the crew of a Whale to number more than 20-25, since this allows a large number of passengers to be carried. Even Whales being used as pure cargo haulers will not usually carry more than this minimal crew. Standard liners will usually be equipped to carry 60-80 passengers, while Whales used as troop transports will be outfitted to carry 100-400 troops.
    Ship Uses: |
    Passenger Liner: |
    The Whale was designed as a large hauler, and it performs extremely well when the cargo that it is hauling is passengers. The quality of these liners is usually fairly high, since it is an expensive ship to begin with, so most owners tend not to scrimp too much on amenities. Most Whales used as liners are roughly equivalent in comfort to an above-average inn, but some have become famous for their shear opulence. The most luxurious of these liners tend to carry only 20-40 passengers, but charge 10-20 times what most luxury services would charge. Those few Whale liners which do not pay much attention to comfort tend to be cut-rate vessels which cram as many passengers aboard as possible. There are a number of different firms using Whales as liners throughout the known spheres , ranging from one-ship operations to massive lines. One of the most successful is the Pandros Line out of Theiaspace , which is run by a female halfling named Calia_Thornbow . Others include Brilliant Night Tours, Fraldathiagn Haulers, and Meer, Dostrol, Hampstad, and Klatchkapper, Ltd.
    Bulk Hauler: |
    Almost as frequently as they are used as passenger liners, Whales can be found serving as bulk cargo haulers. These large ships are one of the few economical ways of transporting quantities of low-value goods, such as grain, cloth, or timber, and those with powerful enough helms will frequently tow one or more cargo barges for further economy. Most Whales used as bulk haulers will have regular shipping runs, often supplying asteroid bases and cities with needed goods on a contract. A Whale being used as a speculative free trader is virtually unheard of. A Whale bulk hauler will frequently carry passengers for a minimal fee, but unlike their liner brethren, they tend to offer no amenities for the passengers beyond a berth. Often such passengers will be expected to supply their own food and drink.
    Military Support: |
    A significant number of military organizations use Whales as heavy support craft, typically hauling large numbers of troops and supplies simultaneously. These ships are spartan and utilitarian, and are most commonly seen in invasion fleets. Since a Whale used in this role will typically be carrying 2-4 times as many men as its air envelope can safely support, magical means of refreshing the air envelope are highly recommended for all but the shortest of voyages ( Fog Cloud spells are the most commonly-used method). Even when used as a military vessel, a Whale usually stays out of combat, since it carries little weaponry. Sometimes, however, a Whale will be used to break up enemy formations by simply ramming the largest enemy craft, allowing allied combat ships to mop up the other enemy ships. Since a Whale is able to simply plow through most small and medium ships, as well as cause massive damage to larger ships, this can be an effective tactic.
    Illithid Crew: |
    In areas in which standard mind_flayer ships tend to be attacked on sight, the Whale has become a popular ship for the illithids. The enclosed vessel appeals to illithid sensibilities, although its lack of weaponry tends to limit it to peaceful applications. Such ships will be powered by a pool helm, and will typically operate in such a manner that passers-by will never realize that the Whale is not manned by humans.
    Other Configurations:
    Killer Whale: |
    In this version of the Whale, large portions of the observation deck are cut away to transform it into a weapons deck. While this section of the ship then becomes vulnerable to attack (reduce AR to 6), this allows as many as a dozen large weapons to be mounted, typically a mix of medium and heavy ballistas and catapults . The cargo space of a Killer Whale is reduced depending on what weapons are carried. As yet the Killer Whale is an uncommon, but deadly warship. There are rumours that a pirate Killer Whale exists, operated by a mixed crew of humans and illusionist gnomes . This ship uses illusions of solid walls to make it appear as a standard Whale until it attacks its unsuspecting victims. The crew of this ship seems to have a great hatred for tinker gnomes, and attacks them in preference to other targets.
    Glass Whale: |
    This variant on the Whale is simply an opulent liner in which the heavily armoured bow has been made clear using Glassteel spells to provide a "window on wildspace " for the passengers. The Arnazdo Operation ( Milo_Arnazdo , proprietor) uses Glass Whales as the symbol of their passenger service, and backs up the fragile-looking (but actually very sturdy) ships by stationing powerful wizards on board.

    Summary: |
      The Whelk is a spelljamming ship built and used by gnomes.
    Description: |
      The Whelk is a grown ship, much like the elven Flitters and Armadas . In fact, the Whelk was developed by forest gnomes working with elven shipwrights, and using modified versions of the spells used by the elves to grow their ships. Whelks appear as spiraled sea shells dotted by sharp spikes along the whorls, traveling large-end first through the void. The graceful design of the Whelk is in sharp contrast to most gnomish designs, which tend to be hodgepodges of different ships and naval architectural styles, as if the designer was changing his mind as he built it (an impression which is often accurate). This is because the Whelk is not built by the tinker gnomes familiar to spacefarers, but is instead built by the more reclusive forest gnomes, specifically illusionist forest gnomes who enjoy a loose alliance with the Imperial Elven Navy.
    Crew: |
      The Whelk is designed specifically for gnomes, and no allowance has been made for larger crew or passengers - the quarters and passageways are gnome-sized and larger creatures must make do or sleep on the outer deck. A Whelk will occasionally carry one or more elven passengers, but this is rare, and the elves usually find this uncomfortable unless they are particularly short. The crew requirements listed above are the theoretical minimum and maximum for human -sized crew. A crew of gnome-sized creatures has a crew of 30/60.
      The command staff of a Whelk is entirely made up of gnome illusionists - captain, helmsman, chief mage, and weapons officer - of levels 2-12. In addition there will be 1-4 additional illusionists of levels 1-6 amongst the crew. The rest of the crew (typically a total of about 40 gnomes will be on board) is made up of gnome warriors of levels 0-3. The command staff and other illusionists use their spells to increase the apparent dangerous nature of the ship (large monsters on deck, additional weaponry, etc.). Those of sufficient level may use Hallucinatory Terrain to mask the appearance of the ship, making it appear as a star field (although movement spoils this illusion). In addition to the crew, the Whelk will be home to either a family of normal badgers, or 1-2 giant badgers, who are used as watchdogs and pets.
    Ship Uses:
      Explorer: |
        The original intended use of the Whelk was to serve as an exploration vessel, with the intent that the gnomish crews would coordinate their exploratory efforts with those of their elven friends on other ships. The Whelk's size (big enough to carry sufficient explorers and equipment for long voyages, but small enough to avoid too much attention) and ability to land on land or water make it ideal for this application, especially when combined with the abilities of the crew to camouflage themselves from any natives when necessary.
      Warship: |
        Although armed sufficiently to defend itself from casual attack, the Whelk is not truly designed for combat. Despite this, when the second Unhuman_War erupted many Whelk captains came to the aid of the elves. The Whelks have proved surprisingly effective against the goblinkin, although this has been primarily due to the magical abilities of the crews rather than any innate combat-worthiness of the ship. Whelks using straightforward combat tactics against the goblinkin were quickly overwhelmed, and their crews slaughtered. Those who took full advantage of their crews' abilities to misdirect and confuse their enemies, on the other hand, proved to be invaluable, especially when used in concert with other ships. An unsupported Whelk is nowhere near as competent in combat, but is an excellent scout/spy craft. The success of these Whelks has led some gnomish captains to turn mercenary, hiring their ships out to the highest bidder.
    Other Configurations:
      Warrior: |
        This version of the Whelk is favoured by experienced veterans of many battles. Portions of the Warrior's shell are cut away in strategic locations to allow for better maneuverability, and to allow extra firing ports for large weapons. The portions of the hull are retained, and left in place most of the time (in this configuration the Warrior performs identically to a standard Whelk), but they can be removed and stowed prior to dangerous missions. When this is done, the ship's AR is reduced to 8, but maneuverability rises to C, and five ballistas are revealed. Usually this will come as a complete surprise to the Warrior's enemies, since the missing hull sections will typically be concealed with illusions. The ballistas used are usually light ballistas, but several ships have been known to carry medium ballistas, although this reduces cargo capacity to a mere 5 tons.

    Summary: |
      The Wreckboat is a spelljamming ship built by humans and used by many spacefaring races.
    Description: |
      The Wreckboat is a simple craft designed to be carried by another craft, and to serve as an escape vessel if that craft is wrecked (hence the name). Wreckboats are easily handled by a single spelljammer, and are usually used as a shuttle or captain's gig on a day-to-day basis, while retaining the original purpose in case of an emergency.
    Crew: |
      Wreckboats typically have no crew of their own, instead being used as needed by the crew of their parent vessels. In an emergency, as many as nine M-sized beings can be crammed aboard - twelve if the ballista and ammunition are left behind. This is only recommended for very short trips, however, since it is highly crowded, and dangerously strains the air envelope.
    Ship Uses:
      Lifeboat: |
        The intended use of a Wreckboat is as a lifeboat. The ballista is often set up so that it can be quickly thrown overboard along with its ammunition in case of an emergency. Wreckboats which are only used as lifeboats, and which never (or rarely) see use as a gig, will typically be equipped with either a furnace or a boiler helm, along with enough magical fuel to power the helm for at least a week. This ensures that crew can escape even if no spellcasters are left alive. Wreckboats used in this manner are almost always protected with a Retain Air Envelope spell to keep their air clear of any disasters which may befall the mother ship.
      Gig: |
        Most Wreckboats are primarily used as ship's boats, allowing the mother ship to pick up and drop off crew and passengers on worlds in an inconspicuous manner. Wreckboats are often used as gigs by ships which are unable to land.
    Other Configurations: |
      None: |
        No other configurations of this basic ship have become popular.
