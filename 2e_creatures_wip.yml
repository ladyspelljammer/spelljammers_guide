  Description: |
    The aartuk are nomadic vegetables organized into small tribes. One elder leads each tribe. Constantly seeking worthy adversaries, they are religious fanatics that view war as the ultimate form of art.
    The warrior and elder aartuk look the same. The aartuk body has the general shape of a star. It is covered with thick, flexible bark, similar to spiked leather. The aartuk moves on its branches, the tip of which end in suction cups that the aartuk uses to hold onto vertical or inverted surfaces. Each suction cup houses a cluster of three retractable pseudopods that can be used to handle small objects. The head of an aartuk stands on a six-foot-tall, snake-like stalk that can coil in and out of the center of the star. The head is oblong in shape, with a hole on one end surrounded by three black lumps. These are the sensory organs of the aartuk, which enable it to detect movement via vibration, smell, and infrared vision. The aartuk cannot see visible light.
    Aartuk come in a variety of strains. There are tribes of grey specimens that favor sandy or very dusty environments. Some tribes look more like rough stones, ranging from light brown to dark grey. Other tribes let mosses, mushrooms, and other small plants grow on their limbs; these types generally prefer to live in dense foliage. In all cases, aartuk are capable of concealing themselves in their natural environment (80% chance of success if the viewer is 30 or more feet away).
  Combat: |
    Aartuk can spit a secretion through the opening in their heads. The secretion solidifies upon contact with air and forms a rock-hard pellet that causes 1d8 points of damage. The range and other effects of the pellet are identical to those of a regular sling bullet. An aartuk can shoot one such pellet per round of combat, without any penalty for close combat.
    Instead of shooting a pellet, an aartuk may choose to shoot forth its gooey tongue to entangle an adversary. The sticky tongue is effective up to a maximum distance of 30 feet. When attacked by the tongue, the victim must roll a successful Dexterity check or become immobilized. An unconscious victim is automatically entangled. A successful Strength check is needed to pull free of the sticky tongue, with a cumulative -1 penalty per round of continuous immobilization.
    The goal of the aartuk is to pull the victim to the center of its body. The head then coils back into the center of the body to hold the victim down, while the branches roll back to crush the victim. The aartuk thus causes 1d8 points of damage per round to an immobilized victim. The aartuk does not use its branches for combat in any other fashion. An elder aartuk fights as a warrior, with the addition of priest spells and a more potent missile weapon. The elder's pellet has twice the range as that of a warrior. The pellet produces a small spark on impact. In normal space, the spark has no effect other than tipping off opponents to the real nature of the elder â€“ which is not apparent to humans . I the phlogisto however, the spark ignites a fireball that causes 5d6 points of damage. The elder usually does not light when sailing through phlogiston, in order to avoid accidentally harming itself or other aartuk warriors that could be in the area of effect. By instinct, the elder prudently curls up its front branches just before spitting a pellet.
    The elder is capable of casting spells as a 4th-level priest with a Wisdom of 14 (five 1st-level spells and two 2nd-level spells). It must pray to its god (as a normal priest) to regain its spells. Aartuk elders are likely to have the following spells:
    If prepared for combat: Cause fear , curse , command , darkness , magical stone * , chant , and flame blade.
    When traveling: Detect good , detect magic , endure cold/heat , protection from good , sanctuary , charm person or mammal , and know alignment.
    The elder may cast magical stone on up to three pellets. Although the affected pellets have not yet been secreted at the time the spell is cast, it nonetheless remains effective until all three pellets are actually shot, or until the spell reaches the end of its normal duration. It enables these pellets to hit monsters that only magical weapons can affect. The damage is the same, but the effect vanishes when the pellet hits a target or an obstacle.
    Aartuk warriors normally avoid harming opponents they believe to be able to control spelljamming devices . They try to capture and drag such opponents away from the scene of a combat. If a fight went against them, aartuk would retreat, taking their prisoner with them.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Aartuk can be found anywhere in areas of wildspace or beyond, in the phlogiston. Tales and legends of their past indicate that their original world was destroyed by the Tyrant Race. Aartuk vow an ancestral hate toward beholders , and they go to great lengths to cause these creatures any kind of harm in their power.
    Several individuals once managed to get aboard spelljamming ships and eventually took them over. There are now many tribes with flotillas of ships captured from fallen enemies. The elder of a tribe is the only aartuk in that tribe capable of piloting a spelljamming ship. Slaves are used to control other ships in a flotilla. Once they capture a ship, the aartuk proceed to modify to make it resemble their preferred environment. Depending on the tribes, ships can be made to look like rocky asteroids, suspended gardens, dusty wrecks, etc. Aartuk cannot make spelljamming devices of their own.
    Aartuk do not value precious metals, other than as lures for potential victims. They appreciate gems (their currency), magical weapons, and art pieces related to the topic of war, which they keep as war trophies. Some rare aartuk magical items with various powers are worn as torques at the base of their head stalks, within the cavity at the center of their bodies. These items may improve Armor Class or grant special abilities common to magical rings (such as invisibility , mind shielding , regeneration , or telekinesis ). They are typically reserved for the aartuk aristocracy and the elders (see the Elders description below for both). Humanoids can use aartuk magical torques, wearing them as arm bracers. Only one such item can be used at a time (wearing two prevents either from functioning). Aartuk cannot use any other type of magical items.
    Aartuk live and die for war, which is linked to their religion and reproductive system (see Ecology). Aartuk are known to attack small colonies or isolated warships. When they encounter an obviously weaker opponent, aartuk find it more honorable to take prisoners and question them about the location of a more suitable opponent. They later release all these prisoners (except potential slave pilots) after taking away any gems or war trophies. Different aartuk tribes occasionally ally to attack larger targets, but they generally have no intertribal contact.
    Warriors without an elder are likely to seek another tribe of the same breed; they will offer great war trophies to be accepted as tribe members by the new elder. If warriors do not have a slave pilot, they drift in space, hoping for an unsuspecting vessel to board them. They either attempt to take over that ship â€“ with its pilot alive â€“ or give away part of their treasures to buy themselves safe passage. Aartuk usually are true to their word and will respect a reasonable agreement.
    Aartuk are air breathers and are capable of speech. They need their ships to retain sufficient air, food, and water to travel long distances. They also rely on their elder leader, who can filter stale air to produce oxygen sufficient for 50 aartuk. Because of this limitation, aartuk are not known for not keeping prisoners very long. The are either set adrift on a raft, or unceremoniously dispatched to the storeroom.
    Aartuk speak various dialects specific to their breeds (rustles, snaps, clicks, pops, and whistles). Aristocrats and elders are likely to speak another two or three more tongues among those languages commonly used in their region (or pick at random: Elve 01-20, Human Common 21-40, Beholder 41-70, Neogi 71-80, Dragon 81-90, the Arcane tongue 91-95, or Illithid 96-00).
    Aartuk worship deities of various origins, though all of these are evil patrons of war. Some tribes have adopted the worship of human deities or those of other monstrous creatures. The elder provides the clerical guidance for one specific deity. Aartuk normally burn their dead and keep the ashes (and magical items, if any) within urns. These urns are taboo and no aartuk dares tamper with these for fear of waking the dead.
  Ecology: |
    Aartuk can ingest any kind of nourishment. They normally cook their food and can prepare sophisticated dishes. They absorb their food through an opening underneath their bodies.
    An aartuk reproduces by infecting an unconscious victim with a virus that progressively turns the victimâ€™s flesh to jelly in a few days. The victim loses 1d6 points of Constitution per day until death occurs or until a cure disease spell destroys the virus (a convalescent recovers 1 point of Constitution per day). A fully grown aartuk warrior â€“ with the memories of the warrior who infected the victim â€“ emerges from the jelly in one month.
    Aartuk infect victims by leaving their tongues on a open wound for three rounds. Aartuk view the gift of birth as a sign of respect and honor toward a victim. The infection of a victim is a religious ritual that must be overseen by the elder of the tribe. There is no gender among the aartuk.
    The bodies of aartuk, either dead or alive, provide no useful components for magic, though the slime on their tongue makes an effective glue when boiled to the appropriate concentration. The tongues may be hung and left to dry for several weeks, which produces an average quality rope. When properly fermented, the sap of elders makes a beverage greatly desired by beholders. An elder provides enough sap to brew a small keg of aartukia . A shrewd merchant could get several thousand gold pieces for the sale of a single keg.
  Elder: |
    The elder is a very old, wise aartuk warrior. It is clear when a warrior aartuk is becoming an elder because it blossoms. This normally happens when a warrior Aartuk reaches 70-90 years of age. Depending on its breed, the aartuk's flowers may look like rocky outgrowths, very colorful mushrooms, or sweet-smelling, exuberant orchids.
    During that period, the aartuk becomes the equivalent of the human aristocrat. Although the aristocrat is identical to a common warrior (in game terms), it is nevertheless treated with much deference by its fellow warriors, and it does not have to undertake menial duties. This increased respect is explained by the fact that an aartuk's blooming signifies either its imminent death or its final transformation to elderhood. The flowers last for about one Earth year, after which they wither and fall off. At that point, the aartuk must roll a successful saving throw vs. death magic or shrivel and die as well.
    If it survives, the aartuk sheds its skin and regains a newer, stronger vitality. It is then hailed as a new elder, and it soon leaves with a small group of younger followers to start another tribe. A new elder lives another 41-60 years, after which it dies of old age. A new tribe is traditionally granted one spelljamming ship and, whenever possible, a few slave pilots and some treasure. If the mother tribe has only one ship, the two elders fight a traditional duel that ends in the death of one of them. The survivor takes over the tribe.
    Aartuk can tell an elder from common aartuk by its smell. Other races that do not have a keen sense of smell cannot readily tell the difference. Elders are immune to those spells or magical effects that either control the physical movement of plants or alter their physical shapes.

  Description: |
    The albari are a race of magical, bird-like creatures that are equally at home i wildspace or the phlogisto . They are dedicated to the call of chaos and seem to exist for no other reason but to throw other beings' lives into unrest.
    An albari possesses a long, almost-human face with a wide beak and slanted, beady eyes. No ears are visible, though an albari's hearing is very keen. The creature's face, like the rest of its body, is covered by short, oily feathers. These range in color from pure white to sooty gray, with the male's coloration tending toward the lighter shades. An albari's wings are impressive, and many specimens have been found with wingspans of up to nine feet. Small, clawed hands can be found on the wings, about halfway along their length. The creature uses these for simple manual tasks, like eating. For more complex activities, the albari uses its feet. Graced with a strong opposable digit, an albari's feet are much like huma hands, with the main difference being the number and type of fingers. Three sharply taloned digits and one thickly clawed opposable thumb rest at the end of both the albari's long, jointed legs. All albari are practiced in balancing on one leg and using the other to manipulate objects.
    They speak their own high-pitched, shrieking language, as well as various trade dialects and the languages of many spacefaring races.
  Combat: |
    Albari avoid physical combat whenever possible. If forced into a physical confrontation in the air, they attack with their two taloned feet, which cause 1d3 points of damage each. On the ground. they attack first with their beaks, inflicting 1-2 points of damage, then with one foot for 1d3 points.
    Magic, specifically illusion, is the preferred weapon of the albari. All albari have the ability to become invisible at will. They can cast change self , ventriloquism , blur , and misdirectio , each twice per day. They can cast phantasmal killer , dream , hallucinatory terrain , and mislead , each once per day. As any albari's motivation can change with alarming speed, it is difficult to state exactly how these spells will be employed. However, it's safe to assume that they will always attempt to confound their enemies with illusions before running away.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Though albari revel in chaos, there is often a method to their madness. An albari will decide upon a specific course of action â€“ say, insuring that a ship gets hopelessly lost in the phlogiston â€“ and stick to it for a short period of time. On average, this period is 1d6 days. At the end of that time, the creature might then change its mind or decide to continue. Albari usually do the former. They can be hard set upon ruining a ship one moment, then try everything in their power to save it the next.
    They use their illusionary powers to sow chaos as much as possible. Often, an albari will use a dream spell upon the captain of a passing ship, simply to cause him to change course. They sometimes make short-term deals with other creatures in space, such as murderoids , agreeing to lure unwary ships to their doom. On the other hand, albari have also been known to lead ships to vast treasures for little or no reward. Their favorite trick, however, is to trail a ship until it gets into a combat situation, then fly to the opposing ship and reveal everything they know. Of course, the albari can lie in this situation, too.
    Because albari need air to breathe, they often tag along inside a ship's air pocket in the phlogiston, remaining invisible, but casting an occasional spell to keep things lively aboard the vessel theyâ€™ve adopted. Albari frequently sneak aboard ships, too. Then they are often magically disguised as a halfling , rock hopper , or other small humanoid.
    Causing trouble takes up most of the albari's time, though pairs occasionally get together to mate. Young albari spend a few weeds hidden in a haphazardly constructed nest before venturing out on the unsuspecting world. These nests can usually be found almost anywhere secretive, though, true to the albari's nature, nests have been found in the middle of busy ports.
  Ecology: |
    The albari is hated by most intelligent races throughout the spheres . Some creatures, like the neogi , slay an albari on sight. Few economic uses have been discovered for the albari, however. Its meat is tough and foul-tasting. and its feathers are far too oily for ornamental use. On a few worlds, heavily treated albari-feather pillows are a status symbol, more for their rarity than their utility.

  Description: |
    An alchemy plant can change its essence into that of any inorganic matter that touches it. The plant can also convert one material into another, as explained below. Matter that was formerly alive, such as a wooden staff, cotton or wool clothing, or a corpse, also qualifies for transformation purposes. The plant is highly sought by alchemists.
    The plant normally looks like an unremarkable bush with serrated green leaves. It grows anywhere, using its transmuting ability to thrive in exotic environments. The only distinguishing characteristic is the lack of other vegetation in a 1' radius around the plant.
  Combat: |
    The alchemy plant easily falls victim to a thoughtless swing of an adventurer's sword or the teeth of a hungry herbivore. However, it senses other live plants growing within 20'; when such plants take damage, the alchemy plant recognizes this and instinctively reacts to preserve itself by transforming into some nearby substance.
    For this reason, the alchemy plants that survive best grow beside rocks. As a herbivore is about to chomp into the succulent brown stalks, the alchemy plant turns into a plant-shaped rock. The plant can also transform in the split-second after a weapon makes contact and before it cuts through the plant, resulting in a solid steel plant. The plant saves vs. crushing blow, using the column appropriate to the material it has duplicated. Of course, a weapon striking such a plant must also save! The transformation lasts so long as danger still threatens.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Alchemy plants grow wild, converting inorganic matter in the soil into food. They do not photosynthesize; thus, they do not require light. Alchemy plants take in carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen, providing an important service to spelljamming vessels.
    The alchemy plant can transform substances into other substances. When two objects touch the plant, one is transformed into the other's substance. Roll randomly (an even chance) to determine the object transformed. Thus, to make the plant create gold, touch the plant with a rock, then a piece of gold â€“ and cross your fingers! An alchemy plant can convert one pound of matter per foot of plant height, to a maximum of three pounds. The transformation works only once per day.
    Supposedly smart people have touched gold to an alchemy plant, watched the plant turn to gold, then pulled it out of the ground. The result is a dead green bush: The plant must stay alive to keep its own transformation intact, though this does not apply to other transformed matter.
    A charm plant spell or a potion of plant control ensures precisely the transformation the caster desires. Attempts to convince the plant to effect a transformation using speak with plants seldom work. The plant cannot be bullied, as it has no concept of its own death or pain. Only a druid can hope to convince the plant to create a transformation; the druid must make an Intelligence check to succeed.
    Alchemy plants cannot duplicate magical energy. Thus, for instance, a candle of invocation touched against the alchemy plant creates only a small block of wax.
    Every month, the alchemy plant has a 5% chance to produce a new seed. The seed is hurled by explosive force to a new spot 10d6 yards away from the parent. (An unfortunate character who intercepts the seed in its flight takes 1 hp damage.) The seed grows from seedling to maturity in two weeks.
  Ecology: |
    Alchemy plants are at the bottom of the food chain, giving nutrition to wandering herbivores. Beyond this, only sages, mages, and alchemists have any interest in the plant, since its performance is undependable. Still, the alchemy plant can be found on board huma , elvish , and illithid ships, where it freshens the air and possibly provides needed substances.

  Description: |
    The allura are a race of reptilian monsters who lure spacefaring men to their doom using innate magical abilities. They use their limited shapechanging power to disguise themselves as beautiful females of their victims' race. Spells or devices that pierce illusions cannot detect an allura's true form.
    The allure most often resemble beautiful huma women, always wearing ornate clothing and flashing exquisite jewelry.
  Combat: |
    Allura feed on the emotions created by tension, excitement, and fear. To gather these emotions, the allura can cast the following spells at 12th level once per day: charm perso , sleep , friends , suggestio , demand , clairaudience , clairvoyance , delude , and mass suggestio.
    The allura have another innate ability, detect life . This ability lets the allura automatically detect the presence of life within 500'.
    When a spelljammer appears in their area, the allura quickly use clairvoyance to locate the spelljamming wizard and demand to lure him to them. Once they sight the ship, the allura pretend to be shipwreck survivors or escaped prisoners from a slave ship.
    Once they board a ship, the allura quickly and invisibly take over key personnel with their spells. All members of the crew get the usual saving throws against each spell, but if one allura's spell doesn't work, the other allura are ready to cast theirs on the strong-willed crew members. If any can still resist, the allura have no compunction against fighting more conventionally, using all the offensive spells and weapons at their disposal.
    Once they control most of the crew, the allura create illusions that evoke strong emotion, such as battles or the dangers of wildspace . One tale tells of allura who convinced a dragonship crew to attack a neogi deathspider . Though the dragonship was destroyed, the allura fed well.
    After two weeks, the captured survivors become listless and drained from the allura's emotional vampirism. Crew members in this condition have their Constitution, Strength and Intelligence scores temporarily halved. The allura magically incapacitate the now-useless crew and abandon the survivors on the nearest asteroid . The allura end up adrift on an empty ship, unable to spelljam, looking for new victims.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Groups of allura stay together for their entire lives. Legends of the spaceways say that they are immortal, always trying to create higher levels of danger for their crews, to garner stronger emotions to feed on, to find new experiences.
  Ecology: |
    If the allura don't feed on new emotions every four months, their appearance degenerates, revealing their true reptilian form. While in this state, they hide when a ship comes into their range and provoke their first victim into fighting a fellow crew member. Using these emotions to regenerate, they regain their beauty in 2d4 rounds.

    Morale: Steady (11-12)
    XP Value: 35
  Description: |
    Anadian halflings are the epitome of extremes. When they like something, they love it, but when they don't like it, they abhor it. This extremist attitude is exhibited in everything they do or say. The southern halflings hate anything that is not part of their family unit, while the northern halflings hate anything that does not contribute to the law and order of their community.
    Anadian halflings average 3Â½ feet in height and have dark, almost jet black skin. Their eyes and hair are very dark colored as well. Their clothing is usually white or any other light color that helps reflect the Su 's intensity away from the skin. The Anadian halflings have their own tongue which resembles common in many ways. This makes communication between Anadians and visiting spelljamming races possible, but excruciatingly slow.
  Combat: |
    Anadian halflings fight with great ferocity when in defense of their homes or beliefs. They are extremely skilled in the bow and the sling, giving them a +3 bonus on all attack rolls.
    When equipped for battle, the halflings wear non-metallic armor because of the shortage of metals on Anadia - what metal is mined is used in the construction of defense walls for important buildings, or for heavy weaponry. When fighting hand to hand, the Anadians usually use hand axes, short swords, and daggers.
    The Anadian halflings are very resistant to magic and poisons, so they gain a +4 to all saving throws. They are also clever and silent. In combat, opponents receive a -5 penalty to their surprise rolls, and in all types of natural terrain, the Anadian halfling is considered invisible when purposely hiding in vegetation.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Halfling counties in the Northern Polarate generally have 10 to 30 villages, with each village containing 50 to 500 or more halflings. There are a total of 13 counties in the Northern Polarate.
    For every 30 halflings in a particular area, there are two 3rd-level fighters and a 4th-level priest. Every county contains at least ten 5th-level fighters and two 6th-level priests. The main government consists of a group of 39 men and women who are a mixture of 3rd- to 6th-level fighters and 2nd- through 6th-level priests. This group of halflings ensures that the county governments are not passing laws that could limit the freedoms of the people in any way.
    The Southern Polarate halflings have no set governmental standard. Any single family able to take control from the current ruling family becomes the new law. This creates complete anarchy in many areas, because no family is able to maintain a sense of control over all areas for any amount of time. This also means that the southern halflings have a very short life span. Since every family is fighting everyone else, the life expectancy is only about 25 years.
    A southern polarate family's most important possession is a fertile woman. To combat the incredible population losses from war, the survivors breed like rabbits. Not many of the halflings in the Southern Polarate enjoy life, but no one is willing to stop the fighting because no one can trust anyone else.

  Description: |
    The anadjiin is a vicious predator that originated on the planet Anadia , the first planet in the Realmspace solar system. These creatures appear to be slightly humanoid in shape, but they have very tough reptilian hide which deflects most weapons. The top of the anadjiin head has a spiny crest which looks similar to that of a stegosaurus dinosaur. This crest has an abundance of small capillary blood vessels at the surface which allow the creature to cool off in the hottest of environments. This crest also disables the creature's ability to survive in colder climes.
    The anadjiin has two insect-like eyes sitting on the side of the head. This positioning allows the creature to see in a 360-degree arc at all times. The brain of the anadjiin is so complex that it is able to assimilate all the information received as well as react to it.
    Its mouth is a bit unusual when compared to those of most other creatures. The mouth sits vertically on the face, instead of horizontally. The teeth are aligned vertically as well, and are very sharp. Once the creature has hold of a victim, there is no way to force the anadjiin to release the grasp, short of killing it. Even then, the jaw must be broken before the hold is released. The chin, instead of being under the mouth, is split in two, with a cleft on either side of the mouth.
    The anadjiin has a stout tail which it uses to stabilize itself should it ever be pushed, or lose its balance. The tail is never used as a weapon. Each of the anadjiin's hands is layered with six-inch long claws. It prefers to use these claws as slicing weapons, attacking with each hand every round. The claws act as though they were blades of sharpness . Anyone attacked by them suffers an additional hit point of damage per round per wound until the wounds are bound or healed.
  Combat: |
    The anadjiin prefers to hunt during the day, because it cannot see in the dark. It therefore hides and sleeps during the night. When it does attack, the anadjiin uses its speed and agility to gain the initial advantage. If the opponent is alone, it attacks with a bite. If the bite attack is successful, it does not release its hold until the opponent is dead. It flails wildly at the abdomen of prey, hoping to sever the entrails, which quickens the death of the prey.
    If there are multiple targets, the anadjiin still uses its bite attack, but it does not hold on. Its genius intelligence knows that stupid fighting like that is the sure way to die. Instead, the anadjiin moves about, attacking mostly one target, usually the weakest, until it falls. At that point, it tries to scare the rest of the targets away, so it can carry its prey back to its lair.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The anadjiin is a very caring parent and mate, ready at any time to fight to the death to protect its young. However, in times when food is rare, anadjiin are known to kill and eat their young to keep them from feeling the pain of starvation. Separate family units often work together to find food. They never fight among themselves whenever prey is found. Each realizes the amount of effort put forth, and demands a share equal to that. This relationship, which is quite unique to predators, is one reason that the anadjiin is well respected. Besides their own language, it is unknown whether the anadjiin have the capabilities to speak common or any other language known in the spheres . No one has stayed around long enough to find out.
  Ecology: |
    When hunting, the anadjiin is careful to preserve the balance of nature. It never hunts or kills any prey that is rare or endangered. The anadjiin feels a strong bond with nature itself, and feels compelled to hunt only that prey which is most abundant. This explains why the anadjiin hunt humans when they are transported to other planets, but do not hunt humans on Anadia. They do, however, prey on the halflings and umber hulks of Anadia whenever possible, because there are so many of both.

  Description: |
    An ancient mariner is the undead spirit of a member of a long-lost evil race that once sailed the phlogisto seas.
    A true ancient mariner is basically humanoid in appearance. Its neck is a little too long and its torso is somewhat compressed compared to those of a huma . The eyes and jaw bulge out from the face. Its voice is quavery, as if being heard from a great distance.
    An ancient mariner is partially transparent. It is seen wearing the bright, garish clothing normally associated with pirates and buccaneers. It appears as it did on the day it died, causing each to be unique. This may mean an eye patch, scars, or even a wooden peg leg. While the mariner might carry a weapon of virtually any type, this is also ghostly and cannot cause damage.
  Combat: |
    The chill touch of the ancient mariner inflicts 1d6 points of cold damage and causes the victim to lose one level. As with other undead that use this attack form, this effect reduces the Hit Dice, class bonuses, spell abilities, etc.
    They can be turned as wights by priests. Like most undead, ancient mariners are immune to sleep , charm , hold , and cold-based spells. They are immune to any type of mind control spell as well. They can be hit only by magical weapons.
    Any creature killed by the energy drain of an ancient mariner becomes an mariner shadow with most of the abilities of a normal shadow. The newly formed undead obeys the ancient mariner completely. (Beings killed by these shadows are merely dead, and do not become shadows or any other form of undead.) A mariner shadow retains its former appearance, though it is now partially transparent. The power of the ancient mariner is such that all of the victim's equipment stays with it, becoming ghostly as well, unable to touch or be touched by living hands. The equipment cannot be used by the mariner shadow.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Ancient mariners are found only in phlogiston. They will not enter a crystal sphere under any circumstances. It is thought that they need the phlogiston to power their ghost ships.
    If more than one ancient mariner is encountered, one of them is the recognized leader and called by its crew. This leader has 6+3 Hit Dice and is turned as a wraith. Ancient mariners are always encountered with a crew of 1d20 mariner shadows, culled from any mixture of spacefaring races. Some large ships have been known to have larger crews of mariner shadows. If the captain is turned, he orders the entire ship to break off combat and flee.
    The greatest power of the ancient mariner captain is to make any object become as insubstantial as the mariner itself. This power requires the captain to touch the object and concentrate for a turn. Once the object is changed, any ancient mariner or mariner shadow can handle it. In this way the treasure hoards of ancient mariners are increased.
    A captain can do this to a spelljamming ship as well, which conversion takes a full day of concentration. They prefer human ships, such as galleons , hammerships , and caravels . Part of the ancient mariner's undead energy is given to the ship, which makes the vessel insubstantial, partially transparent, and fuels it. It moves as if powered by a 5th-level spellcaster. The ship becomes immune to all physical or magical attacks. It has no physical substance, passing right through other objects. It holds no air. The ghostly deck hands appear to walk normally upon it, even swarming up the rigging occasionally. A captain can maintain only one ship at a time in this fashion, although he can release a ship from his sway and convert another.
    If the ancient mariners on a ship are all killed, the mariner shadows vanish instantly, becoming truly dead. The ghost ship becomes solid and can be boarded and searched. There is a 50% chance that the spelljamming helm is still usable. If only the captain is killed, the ancient mariner with the highest hit points becomes the new captain.
  Ecology: |
    Unlike most undead, ancient mariners do not seem to be tied to a place or a person. They can roam freely, at least in phlogiston, and trade ships at will.
    The original race of the ancient mariners must be long extinct, since they look like no race in the known crystal spheres.

  Description: |
    The Aperusa are wildspace gypsies. They are a swarthy, nimble, handsome folk who dress in colorful silks and lots of jewelry. For all intents and purposes, they act like groundling gypsies, though no one knows whether the Aperusa are groundling gypsies who somehow made it into space, or spacefarers who met gypsies and chose to imitate them. Like other gypsies, the Aperusa are silent about their origins, and they resent intrusions into their pasts. This fanatical concealment of their past overrides even their love for money and "stuff".
    These fun-loving folk wander wildspace in brightly painted, slapdash spelljammers. The Aperusa salvage wrecks, run confidence games, engage in petty thievery, and tell fortunes. They speak their own secret tongue, as well as Thieves' Cant and Common.
  Combat: |
    Treat most Aperusa as 1st-level thieves, their thief skills modified by appropriate Dexterity bonuses. Any Aperusa quickly points out that they are lovers, not fighters. They pursue wealth and fun, not combat and its result, pain. They gladly let others fight their battles for them; in fact, the Aperusa reward their benefactors by selling them healing balms â€“ at bargain prices!
    If combat is inevitable, the Aperusa try to delay fighting until they get the advantage. They defend themselves with short swords and main-gauches (40%), daggers and slings (30%), rapiers (20%), or longswords (10%). They wear no armor, trusting their tough skin and high Dexterity. Some (20%) wear protectio rings and cloaks, or bracers of defense.
    Every Aperusa can feign death once per day, usually after taking a small flesh wound, or falling and pretending to hit his head. After the foe leaves the fight, the Aperusa plot a rematch, making sure the assailants won't know what hit them.
    Aperusa are slightly magic-resistant and 75% immune to all detection spells. Their minds cannot be read, and they cannot have psionic abilities. Furthermore, due to their hearty nature and constant exposure to wildspace, Aperusa have learned to use very little air. Their bodies retain enough air to let them breathe for 2d10 days.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Aperusa, not aggressive overall, give the responsibility of fighting and spying to two groups. The first, Blades, are accomplished warriors, with saving throws and abilities of 5th-level fighters, along with the normal Aperusa thieving skills (also 5th-level). In addition, Blades can cast spells as a 5th-level bard. Thus Blades can power the helm of a spelljammer. Blades are responsible for strategy and tactics for their clans. Only males can be Blades.
    The second group, the Umbra, are spies who infiltrate other races to gather information, scout, and (rarely) assassinate a powerful enemy. Umbra are 5th-level thieves and have the spell abilities of a 5th-level bard. Males and females can be Umbra. In rare cases, some races hire Umbra to carry out spy missions. The Umbra usually cannot resist pilfering a few things for themselves, and they usually get caught.
    Clans: For every 10 Aperusa there are two Blades and one Umbra. (Blades and Umbras look like normal Aperusa.) Twenty or more adult Aperusa make up a familial clan, led by a matriarch or patriarch (or both) of 10+ level â€“ the eldest male and his wife. The clan includes 2d6 children who have the skills of 1st-level thieves, the first skills taught to them. Aperusan clan surnames have a distinctly wildspace flavor. The best known clans are the Wildjammmers, Phlogestos, and the Astralusians.
    Clan leaders, called Beloved Grandfather and Beloved Grandmother, are either Blades or Umbras, with appropriate abilities at 10th level. A leader usually has at least one protective magical item, often a symbol of authority. Clan leaders do not enter combat, though in direst emergencies they can summon a constellate once per year to fight for their clans. The leader permanently loses 1 hp for each summoning.
    If the Grandfather dies, his widow rules the clan, but she may never remarry. If the Grandmother dies instead, the Grandfather may remarry. Aperusans are monogamous.
    Culture: Aperusan culture is thoroughly sexist. Males, considered the brains and brawn of the clan, make all decisions, enjoy the most freedom, and take the best loot found. Females, besides bearing children, doing domestic duties, and tending the sick and wounded, serve the clan in "glamorous" roles like fortunetellers, bait for scam victims, and dancers.
    Truly motivated women can become Umbras, though such women still must obey orders from any adult male. Males view non-Aperusan women no better. They especially enjoy taking advantage of women who think the gypsy life "romantic".
    The Aperusa have no single faith; rather, in an effort not to offend or slight any patron whose good graces may someday be needed, they worship whoever seems most impressive at the moment. If an Aperusa is healed by a cleric of Ptah , for instance, the whole clan will be impressed and undergo a mass conversion. Everyone sings and chants to Ptah, wears Ptah's symbols, and swears eternal loyalty to Ptah. This lasts until a cleric of another patron performs a similar feat the following week, whereupon the Aperusa undergo mass conversion and swear to follow the new patron until the end of time.
    Aperusa clans excel at making loaded dice, decks of cards (normal and marked), and small melee weapons such as daggers, knives, darts, and mains-gauche.
  Ecology: |
    The Aperusa help keep wildspace tidy, because they wander space collecting salvage. They are notorious packrats, for they never know what debris may be in demand.
    Inquiries about an Aperusa homeworld are usually greeted with, "What's a homeworld?" Still, some scholars and shamefully optimistic adventurers insist the homeworld exists and is cluttered with treasures that all Aperusa clans give as tribute to the sovereign "King and Queen of the Aperusa".
    Proponents of the homeworld theory each point to one solid piece of evidence: star maps that show the location of the Aperusa homeworld. Of course, the maps were bought from the Aperusa. Of course, no two maps are alike. Of course.

  Description: |
    The arcane are a race of merchants, found wherever there is potential trade in magical items. They appear as tall, lanky, blue giants with elongated faces and thin fingers, each finger having one more joint than is common in most humanoid life. The arcane dress in robes, although there are individuals who are found in heavier armor, a combination of chain links with patches of plate (AC 3).
  Combat: |
    For creatures of their size, the arcane are noticeably weak and non-combative. They can defend themselves when called upon, but prefer to talk and/or buy themselves out of dangerous situations. If entering an area that is potentially dangerous (like most huma cities), the arcane hires a group of adventurers as his entourage.
    The arcane can become invisible , and can dimension door up to three times a day, usually with the intention of avoiding combat. An arcane feels no concern about abandoning his entourage in chancy situations. They can also use any magical items, regardless of the limitations of those items. This includes swords, wands, magical tomes, and similar items restricted to one type of character class. They will use such items if pressed in combat and they cannot escape, but more often use them as bartering tools with others.
    Arcane have a form of racial telepathy, such that an injury to one arcane is immediately known by all other arcane. The arcane do not seek vengeance against the one who hurt or killed their fellow. They react negatively to such individuals, and dealing with the arcane will be next to impossible until that individual makes restitution.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Nothing is known about the arcane's origins; they come and go as they please, and are found throughout the known worlds . When they travel, they do so on the ships and vehicles of other races. Finding such ships with arcane aboard is rare, and it is suspected that the arcane have another way of travelling over long distances.
    Contacting the arcane is no trouble in most civilized areas: a few words spread through the local grapevine, through taverns, guilds, and barracks, are enough to bring one of these creatures to the surface. In game terms, there is a base 10% chance per day of finding an arcane, if PCs actively look for one; the chance increases or decreases depending on their location. Arcane never set up permanent magic shops.
    The arcane's stock in trade is to provide magical items, particularly spelljamming helms , which allow rapid movement through space . The arcanes' high quality and uniform (if high) prices make them the trusted retailers. They accept payment in gold, or barter for other magical items (as a rule of thumb, costs should be five times the XP reward of the item, or a more valuable item).
    The arcane take no responsibility for the use of the items they sell. The arcane will deal with almost anyone. They often make deals with both sides in a conflict, fully aware that they might annihilate all of their potential customers in a region. The arcane have no dealings with neogi , nor with creatures from other planes, such as genies , tanar'ri, and fiends. It is unknown whether the arcane create a wide variety of magical devices, or secure them from an unknown source.
    Those dealing with the arcane find them cool, efficient, and most importantly, uncaring. Trying to haggle with an arcane is a chancy business, at best. Sometimes they will engage in haggling with a bemused smirk, but just as often leave the buyer hanging and walk out on the negotiations. They do not like being threatened, insulted, or blackmailed. Those who do so will find it very difficult to purchase reliable equipment. An arcane will not raise his hand in vengeance or anger â€“ there are more subtle ways to wreak revenge.
  Ecology: |
    It is not known what arcane do with the gold, gems, and magic they collect. One theory says they need the items for reproduction (the basis for a large number of bawdy arcane jokes), while another links it to production and acquisition of more magical items. The arcane seem sexless. No young arcane have been reported, and the arcane keep their own counsel.

  Description: |
    Argos are found in the same regions of wildspace as the baleful beholder nations. An argos resembles a giant amoeba. It has one large, central eye with a tripartite pupil, and a hundred lashless, inhuman eyes and many sharp-toothed mouths. An argos can extrude several pseudopods, each tipped with a fanged maw that functions as a hand to manipulate various tools.
    Argos move by slithering; they can cling to walls and ceilings. They can levitate and fly at the very slow rate of 3.
    Argos colors tend toward shades of transparent blues and violets; they smell like a bouquet of flowers. They are huge beasts ranging in size from 10 to 20 feet in diameter, weighing about 200 pounds per Hit Die. Though they exhibit signs of being intelligent tool users, they do not wear clothes, choosing rather to carry gear stored in temporary cavities within their bodies. However, their digestive juices often ruin devices within two to three weeks (saving throw vs. acid).
  Combat: |
    An argos can attack with one to three weapons or items, or it can enfold a victim in a pseudopod and attack with 1d3 mouths for 1d4 points of damage each. It may attack as many foes in this way as it can physically reach.
    If an argos rolls a natural 20 on an attack, it envelopes its victim, swallowing him whole. A swallowed victim suffers 2d8 points of damage each round from the creature's digestive juices. The victim may attempt to cut his way free from within, using only short cutting weapons. He must inflict 8 points of damage to break free.
    The eyes of an argos, like those of a beholder, have a variety of special powers. An argos can bring 1d10 of its smaller eyes to bear on any target. The large, central eye can focus only on targets that are in front of the creature (within 90 degrees of the "straight-ahead point" of the central eye). Though the creature has nearly 100 eyes, only 20 special powers have been noted; therefore a number of eyes must possess the same power.
    Each point of damage inflicted on an argos eliminates one eye; the DM decides which powers are reduced in the process. It is possible to target one particular eye by attacking with a -4 penalty to the attack roll.
    Each ability of an argos's eye is treated as a spell effect. Use the argos's Hit Dice as the caster level. Roll 1d20 and check the following table for a particular eye's power.
    1. Blindness
    2. Burning Eyes (Hands)
    3. Charm Monster
    4. Clairvoyance
    5. Confusion
    6. Darkness, 15' rad.
    7. Dispel Magic
    8. Emotio
    9. ESP
    10. Fumble
    11. Gaze Reflectio
    12. Heat Metal
    13. Hold Monster
    14. Improved Phantasmal Force
    15. Irritatio
    16. Light
    17. Slow
    18. Suggestio
    19. Tongues
    20. Turn Flesh to Stone
    The central eye can use one of three different powers once per round. It can create a personal illusion (an alter self spell), or it can cast a color spray or a ray of enfeeblement spell.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Argos are solitary creatures, though it is not unheard of to discover an argos guardian aboard an eye tyrant ship. Argos appear capable of replenishing their own air envelope and thus may be encountered wandering asteroid rings and dust clouds alone.
    Despite its relative intelligence, the argos is a ravenous creature driven by its hunger. It tries to lure prey into its grasp, feeding until it has consumed a number of creatures equal to two times its own Hit Dice. It then slips away to digest its meal for a period equal to two hours per Die. If an argos is unable to find food within a week of its last meal, it loses 1 Hit Die per week until it becomes a 5-Hit Die creature. After that point, it can hibernate for up to a year by crystallizing its outer shell and forming a chrysalis.
  Ecology: |
    Argos consume anything that moves and is digestible. Their preference is to use their abilities to lure their prey into traps and then to pick off individuals one at a time. It sorts through the tools and weapons of its victims and keeps the useful items.

  Description: |
    In general, beholders and beholder-ki are a very intelligent (and conceited) lot. Which is precisely why all of them deny any relation to the astereater. Though technically a beholder-kin, the astereater has none of the intelligence or magical abilities its cousins possess. In appearance, the astereater resembles a large beholder (minus the eye stalks) with one other major difference: The skin of the creature is virtually identical â€“ in appearance and consistency â€“ to rock. Like the beholder, astereaters have a large, central eye and a large mouth filled with pointed teeth.
    Astereaters speak their own language, which consists of very few words. They rarely hold a conversation with anything.
  Combat: |
    The rock-like skin of the astereater protects it very well. When its eye and mouth are shut, the creature is virtually impervious to any but very powerful or magical attacks.
    The astereater's normal method of attack is to hide at the edge of an asteroid field and wait for passers-by to wander too close. It attacks using its huge mouth. A normal hit inflicts 2d4 points of damage, but any attack roll that exceeds the number needed by 5 or more means the astereater has swallowed its prey whole (obviously this doesn't apply if the opponent is larger than the astereater). For example, if an astereater needs an attack roll of 9 or better to hit, and the roll is 14 or greater, then the victim is swallowed whole.
    Anyone inside the belly of an astereater receives 1d6 points of damage per round from the powerful digestive acids found there. The victim may attack the astereater only if he held a small-sized weapon prior to being swallowed. Treat the interior of the astereater as AC 5. If the trapped person manages to inflict 12 points of damage to the creature's stomach, he is expelled from the monster. The astereater cannot attack if it has someone in its stomach.
    With its eye and mouth shut, the astereater is almost identical to an asteroid in appearance. At distances of 30 feet or less, the astereater is 50% likely to be mistaken for an asteroid. At distances greater than 30 feet, it is indistinguishable from an asteroid. Since the astereater is too slow to retreat from combat, it chooses its opponents carefully before revealing itself and attacking.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Like all beholder-kin, astereaters are hateful and cruel. They cooperate neither with each other or anyone else unless it is of great benefit to themselves.
    Astereaters hoard no treasure as they have no need for such trifles. However, in the bellies of these creatures (particularly older ones) there is usually a fair amount of incidental treasure that the creature cannot digest. In older astereaters it is common to find dozens of coins, various weapons, useless metal odds and ends, and possibly some magical items and potions (the astereater cannot digest glass or ceramic vials either).
    An extremely rare but notable exception to the normal solitude of the astereaters is their occasional association with small groups of giff . It has been observed that astereaters sometimes act as leaders of giff platoons. Because of the militaristic nature of the giff and their aversion to serve anyone but their own kind, a giff platoon serving under an astereater is typically no larger than 10 giff; the association is generally little more than enslavement. It has been observed that this usually happens when an astereater encounters a giff mercenary platoon that is weak from battle and low in numbers. In this case, the astereater has little trouble domineering the mercenaries. It is unknown why the creatures choose giff as their slaves. Perhaps it is due to the giffs' natural penchant for servitude.
    As a rule, beholders are a vicious species, holding great wars of extermination among their own kind. Whole communities of beholders are casually destroyed as a matter of course. But the hatred of the beholder race is greater still when directed toward astereaters. Beholders see astereaters as large blots against them and they stop at nothing to destroy what they consider to be vile errors of creation.
  Ecology: |
    Astereaters are carnivores that readily eat the flesh of any creature. They seem to prefer sentient species, especially humans and elves . Because of their extreme natural protection, they have no natural enemies but intelligent creatures hunt astereaters for the treasure they may hold in their stomachs.

  Description: |
    These ten-legged beasts build webs between asteroid rocks to trap their prey.
    The asteroid spider is not truly a spider, but it has enough similarities to one that sailors have dubbed as such. It has ten legs, spaced evenly around its globe-shaped body. Each is jointed like that of a spider and ends in a small hook. On the top of the globe are its sensory organs. The eye are on stalks and there are several organs of unknown use. The beasts are all black, making them virtually invisible against most wildspace backgrounds.
    The top of the globe is covered with a hard shell, like that of an insect, but the underside is soft. The mouth is in the center of the underbelly, as is the web-spinning organ. The mouth has a single hollow tooth like a syringe and suction cup lips. All in all an asteroid spider is a hideous creature.
  Combat: |
    Against the black background of wildspace, the asteroid spider is 90% unlikely to be seen. It attacks only the creatures or objects that disturb its web. The attack is made with up to six of its legs (the other four are used to hold onto the web or other surface). Each leg inflicts 1d3 points of damage. If three or more attacks in a single round are successful, the spider clings to the victim. Each round after that, the remaining legs can attack and the mouth can try to bite for 1d6 points of damage. A successful bite requires a saving throw vs. poison. Failure means the victim is paralyzed for 2d6 turns. Paralyzed victims are bundled up in webbing in a single round. The spider then carts the body off to the lair to have a more leisurely meal.
    Until the mouth is trying to bite, only the top of the body (AC 2) is exposed. The vulnerable underbelly (AC 7) is held close to the web. When the mouth attacks, the belly of the spider is an easy target.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Asteroid spiders are only found in asteroid belts or in regions of space junk. They often set up a lair on the surface of a larger asteroid that has enough air to support the colony. They spin webs miles long between their lair and the nearby asteroids and space junk. These webs are strong enough to trap any ship under 15 tons that is not traveling at spelljamming speeds. The webs are black, just like the spiders, and 90% unlikely to be seen against a black wildspace sky.
    The females lay hundreds of eggs on the outside of the lair. Once the eggs hatch, it is a wild race between the hatchlings and the adults. The adults race to catch and eat the new spiders, while the hatchlings race to jump from the asteroid into space. Many of the hatchlings are eaten, while many others float away and die in wildspace. A few land on other asteroids or space junk. The hatchlings join up with other baby asteroid spiders to form a colony. When they reach adulthood, they do not accept any new spiders into the colony, attacking any hatchlings or adults that enter their territory.
  Ecology: |
    Asteroid spiders sometimes wait years between meals. They can go into a form of suspended animation, only waking up when their webbing is disturbed. In this state they use little or no air. After a meal, they expand their web a bit and then return to this catatonic state.
    The asteroid spiders value the air of their victims. They spin a large cocoon of webbing within the air space of a captured ship. When completed, it is sealed and carried to the lair, where it is deflated. The colony carries the cocoon back and forth to the ship, filling and emptying it until the ship only has a thin bubble of air left.
    The poison of the asteroid spider does not keep well, and hence is of little value. The webbing can be cut and coated to eliminate the adhesive qualities. The resulting ropes are very strong, but also susceptible to flames; they do not ignite and burn on their own, but melt away under a flame almost instantly.

  Description: |
    Astrosphinxes are a malevolent breed of sphinx whose origins are shrouded in mystery. Standing twice as tall as a man, the astrosphinx is covered with brass-colored scales like those of a dragon. A pair of huge black bat wings sprouts from its back. The head resembles a goat skull, with tiny pinpricks of violet light in its eye sockets. The head does in fact have flesh; it is just so pale, and stretched so tightly across the skull, that it seems invisible. Instead of forepaws, the astrosphinx has a pair of large, clawed huma hands. The beast exudes a smell of ozone and offal.
    These frightful creations, parodies of true sphinxes, speak the language of all sphinxes and the Common tongue.
  Combat: |
    An astrosphinx uses its two goat horns to attack with a head-butt, each horn doing 2d6 damage. It can bite viciously (4d6 damage). Its human hands have large claws that do 1d6 damage each. In rare instances (5% of the time), the creature wields a two-handed sword, sometimes magical.
    Though the creature has a draconian body, it cannot use its tail or hind legs in combat. It does, however, breathe a cone of sleep gas 80' long, 4' wide at the beast's mouth and 20' wide at the base. Targets caught in the cone must save vs. breath weapon or fall asleep for 1d6 turns. Victims in wildspace in their own air bubbles remain asleep until the gas is somehow flushed out of the air supply. The astrosphinx can employ this breath weapon once every five rounds.
    Finally, the astrosphinx can shoot a 9d6 chain lightning bolt from its eye sockets. There is a one-round delay before hurling the bolt, and a resting of the eyes for one round afterwards. On the round before the bolt fires, the pinpoints of light in the astrosphinx's eye sockets change color from violet to gold. On the round after the bolt is fired, the eyes change to red. At the end of that round, the eyes change back to their normal violet, which means that the eyes have recharged.
    The disadvantage to the sphinx's lightning weapon is that it is blind for the one round of rest. The sphinx suffers a -4 penalty to THAC0 in melee combat during the round of eye rest.
    In melee combat, the astrosphinx attacks homicidally mindlessly until nothing living still stands. As a rule, after its riddle is answered incorrectly (see below), the sphinx breathes its sleep gas, shoots the lightning, then hurls itself into melee. The astrosphinx attacks not only the person who got the riddle wrong, but all companions as well.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Astrosphinxes are fiercely territorial and challenge all intruders to a contest of riddles. Those who answer incorrectly, or do not answer at all, are killed outright. Due to their dementia, the astrosphinxes challenge any living things, even birds, bugs, small animals, and plants.
    The madness of the astrosphinxes renders their riddles unanswerable and illogical: "What is the speed of blue?" "How loud is down?" "What do a kobold and the Spelljammer have in common besides triangles?" Unfortunately, an astrosphinx slays anyone who does not answer its riddle correctly; so, an astrosphinx is usually the only creature on a given planet.
    Some travellers, legend states, have solved an astrosphinx's mad riddle by giving an equally mad or nonsensical answer. This tactic seldom works (1% chance of success). Legend says that if an astrosphinx's riddle is answered correctly, the beasts erupts into a 20d6 ring of chain lightning, killing itself. Supposedly all that is left is a clue to the whereabouts of the Spelljammer.
    The astrosphinx can survive in space without air. It lairs most often on small, barren chunks of rock. The sphinx eats anything, usually those who give wrong answers to its riddles.
  Ecology: |
    The astrosphinx is a bizarre predator that all conscientious races believe is better off hunted down and killed. Not even the evil intelligent races have anything to do with it. Saving any piece of an astrosphinx as a trophy is considered a bad omen, and the owner of the grisly trophy winds up shunned by his fellows.

  Description: |
    An autognome is a mechanical gnome with gears, pulleys, and bits of magic inside it. The tinker gnomes create the autognome for exploration, rescue, prospecting, and defense in environments hostile to human- and demihumankind. It works just as well as any other gnomish invention.
    These automatons resemble gnomes, though no one could ever confuse an autognome with a real gnome. Autognome faces are painted, even down to red circles on their cheeks. They walk with a stiff gait, clanking, wheezing, whirring, and razzing, their arms swinging out of rhythm. Autognomes speak gnomish and Common in a nasal monotone.
    Autognomes are either directed , under the gnomes' control; or rogues , which have forgotten their orders and now wander wildspace doing anything except what they were designed for.
  Combat: |
    Autognomes obey the following directives: (1) defend gnomes under attack by non-gnomes; (2) defend yourself against attack; and (3) defend babies and children from harm. The last directive arose from the best intentions, but unfortunately, it neglects to specify races; so if, for instance, an autognome sees elves battling young beholders , the autognome blasts away at the elves.
    Autognomes attack with two heavy metallic fists, doing 1d10 damage each. Unfortunately, autognomes are slow and always attack last in a round when using their fists.
    Since one of their functions is to collect soil samples from different planets , most autognomes (90%) have a retractable metal scoop. If the scoop is used as a weapon (only when the autognome malfunctions), it inflicts 1d12 damage.
    Some autognomes (33%) are used exclusively for combat, and have a wand of lightning set in their chests. These wands have 5d10 charges remaining and are salvageable after the autognome is defeated or (more likely) when it breaks down and collapses into a useless heap.
    Whichever attack form the autognome uses, it yells as it fights: "Crush! Kill! Destroy! Exterminate, exterminate! Maim! Hurt! Incapacitate!"
    Autognomes save as hard metal. They are immune to poison and all spells except disintegrate.
    Malfunctions: Every successful hit on an autognome has a 10% chance of causing a malfunction. Any time an autognome rolls a 1 for its attack roll, it has a 25% chance of malfunctioning. Finally, an autognome has a 5% non-cumulative chance per day to malfunction. Whatever the cause, roll 1d12 and consult the following table:
  Habitat/Society: |
    Since autognomes are automatons, they have no society or preferred habitat. A gnomish spelljammer has a 10% chance of having 1d4 autognomes on board to explore hostile environments.
    Autognomes can follow up to 100 different orders, including what to do in certain situations, or what minerals to look for on a planet. An autognome can memorize and recite everything it sees and hears in a 24-hour period.
    An autognome can converse with others, but its thought processes are inflexible, and it does not deviate from its orders. Figures of speech are lost on it. Autognome logic is narrow. For instance, an autognome may be ordered to fetch a rock sample. In its travels, it meets a huma warrior named Rok. Therefore, out comes the sample scoop and...
    There is a 1/3 chance that an encountered autognome is a rogue. It has forgotten its orders and is now in one of the following conditions (roll 1d4):
    1) The autognome believes itself to be a real gnome, and tries to live a normal life, including eating, sleeping, etc.
    2) The autognome awaits new orders from anyone it meets.
    3) Same as #2, except it does the opposite of what is it told.
    4) The autognome attacks all living creatures in sight.
    The gnomes guard the secret of building autognomes jealously, though no one but gnomes wants to build the things. It is rumored that it requires many spells such as enchant an item , animate object , and permanency , and it costs at least 10,000 gp.
    For some reason, the dohwar are interested in purchasing intact, working autognomes. All other intelligent races either flee the things or, if the autognome is unaccompanied by a gnome, blow it up.
  Ecology: |
    Autognomes contribute nothing to the ecosystem except for piles of scrap metal when they inevitably break down. Rogue types can be a wildspace hazard.

  Description: |
    The azer are a race of humanoid creatures that normally inhabit the Elemental Plane of Fire. Except under special circumstances, they are very rarely found on the Prime Material Plane. In appearance, they are much like dwarves , except that they have brass-colored skin and flames for hair. Their skin is metallic. They wear only kilts or apronlike garments of beaten brass, copper or bronze.
  Combat: |
    Azer use broad-bladed javelins which inflict damage as spears. In hand-to-hand combat, they employ mallet-like weapons equal to a footman's mace in game terms. Due to their great strength, hit probability is always adjusted, as is damage, as follows:
    Creatures not immune to fire suffer 2-5 points of damage if grasped by an azer, and the heat of an azer's weapons will inflict an additional +1 point of damage to such victims. Azers suffer double damage from cold-based attacks.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Azer on their home plane are part of an extremely regimented society, under the command of their ruler named Amaimo . Within this society, every individual has his or her place. The azer civilization on Garrash is a smaller version of this heavily stratified society, and is described in more detail in the appropriate chapter of this book.
    In general, azer are unfriendly and taciturn, and lack compassion. They are greedy, particularly for gems that are a clear purple or red (e.g., rubies, amethysts, etc.). Once given, the word of an azer is a solid bond.
  Ecology: |
    It is not known just what - if anything - azer eat. On their home plane, their only natural enemies are other intelligent fire-dwelling creatures, and even then this enmity is not related to relative position on the food chain.

beholder:
  Summary:
    Beholders resemble floating orbs of flesh with a large mouth, single central eye, and lots of smaller eyestalks on top with deadly magical powers.
    Beholders in the Spelljammer campaign are common antagonists, like the deadly neogi and sadistic illithids . However, one thing prevents them from being the most dangerous faction in wildspace : the beholders are engaged in a xenophobic civil war of genetic purity.
    There are a large number of variations in the beholder race with some sub-races having smooth hides and others chitinous plates. Other noticeable differences include snakelike eyestalks or crustacean-like eyestalk joints. Some variations seem minor such as variations in the size of the central eye or differences in skin colour. Each beholder nation believes itself to be the true beholder race and sees other beholders as ugly copies that must be destroyed.
    Beholders use a large number of different ship designs. Some of these ships feature a piercing ram but others have no weaponry. All beholder ships allow a circuit of beholders to focus their eye stalks into a 400 yard beam of magical energy. These ships are powered and navigated by the orbus (plural "orbii") race of beholders, who are stunted, albino, and very weak in combat. Hive mothers are even rarer than elder orbs. Although their name implies a feminine gender, these beholders are as gender-neutral as typical members of their species. Their name stems more from the fact that they have the ability to magically dominate other beholders.

  Description: |
    The beholder is the stuff of nightmares. This creature, also called the sphere of many eyes or the eye tyrant , appears as a large orb dominated by a central eye and a large toothy maw, has 10 smaller eyes on stalks sprouting from the top of the orb. Among adventurers, beholders are known as deadly adversaries.
    Equally deadly are a number of variant creatures known collectively as beholder-ki , including radical and related creatures, and an undead variety. These creatures are related in manners familial and arcane to the traditional beholders, and share a number of features, including the deadly magical nature of their eyes. The most extreme of these creatures are called beholder abominations.
    The globular body of the beholder and its kin is supported by levitation, allowing it to float slowly about as it wills.
    Beholders and beholder-kin are usually solitary creatures, but there are reports of large communities of them surviving deep beneath the earth and in the void between the stars, under the dominion of hive mothers.
    All beholders speak their own language, which is also understood by all beholder-kin. In addition, they often speak the tongues of other lawful evil creatures.
  Combat: |
    The beholder has different Armor Classes for different parts of the body. When attacking a beholder, determine the location of the attack before striking (as the various Armor Classes may make a strike in one area, and a miss in another):
    Roll  Locatio         AC
    01-75 Body            0
    76-85 Central Eye     7
    86-95 Eyestalk        2
    96-00 One smaller eye 7
    Each of the beholder's eyes, including the central one, has a different function. The standard smaller eyes of a beholder are as follows:
    1. Charm perso (as spell)
    2. Charm monster (as spell)
    3. Sleep (as spell, but only one target)
    4. Telekinesis (250 pound weight)
    5. Flesh to stone (as spell, 30-yard range)
    6. Disintegrate (20-yard range)
    7. Fear (as wand)
    8. Slow (as spell, but only a single target)
    9. Cause serious wounds (50-yard range)
    10. Death ray (as a death spell, with a single target, 40-yard range)
    The central eye produces an anti-magic ray with a 140-yard range, which covers a 90 degree arc before the creature. No magic (including the effects of the other eyes) will function within that area. Spells cast in or passing through that zone cease to function.
    A beholder may activate the magical powers of its eyes at will. Generally, a beholder can use 1d4 smaller eyes if attackers are within a 90 degree angle in front, 1d6 if attacked from within a 180 degree angle, 1d8 if attacked from a 270 degree arc, and all 10 eyes if attacked from all sides. The central eye can be used only against attacks from the front. If attacked from above, the beholder can use all of the smaller eyes.
    The beholder can withstand the loss of its eyestalks, each eyestalk/smaller eye having 5-12 hit points. This loss of hit points is over and above any damage done to the central body. The body can withstand two thirds of the listed hit points in damage before the creature perishes. The remaining third of the listed hit points are located in the central eye, and destroying it will eliminate the anti-magic ray. A beholder with 45 hit points will have a body that will take 30 points of damage, a central eye that will take 15 points, while one with 75 hit points will have a body that will withstand 50 points of damage, and a central eye that takes 25 hit points to destroy. Both beholders would have smaller eyestalks/eyes that take 5-12 (1d8+4) points of damage to destroy, but such damage would not affect the body or central eye. Slaying the body will kill the beholder and render the eyes powerless. Destroyed eyestalks (but not the central eye) can regenerate at a rate of one lost member per week.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The beholders are a hateful, aggressive and avaricious race, attacking or dominating other races, including other beholders and many of the beholder-kin. This is because of a xenophobic intolerance among beholders that causes them to hate all creatures not like themselves. The basic, beholder body-type (a sphere with a mouth and a central eye, eye-tipped tentacles) allows for a great variety of beholder subspecies. Some have obvious differences, there are those covered with overlapping chitin plates, and those with smooth hides, or snake-like eye tentacles, and some with crustacean-like joints. But something as small as a change in hide color or size of the central eye can make two groups of beholders sworn enemies. Every beholder declares its own unique body-form to be the true ideal of beholderhood, the others being nothing but ugly copies, fit only to be eliminated.
    Beholders will normally attack immediately. If confronted with a particular party there is a 50% chance they will listen to negotiations (bribery) before raining death upon their foes.
  Ecology: |
    The exact reproductive process of the beholder is unknown. The core racial hatred of the beholders may derive from the nature of their reproduction, which seems to produce identical (or nearly so) individuals with only slight margin for variation. Beholders may use parthenogenic reproduction to duplicate themselves, and give birth live (no beholder eggs have been found). Beholders may also (rarely) mate with types of beholder-kin.
    The smaller eyes of the beholder may be used to produce a potion of levitation , and as such can be sold for 50 gp each.
  Death Kiss (Beholder-kin): |
    The Death Kiss, or "bleeder", is a fearsome predator found in caverns or ruins. Its spherical body resembles that of the dreaded beholder, but the eyestalks of this creature are bloodsucking tentacles, its eyes are hook-toothed orifices. They favor a diet of humans and horses, but will attack anything that has blood. An older name for these creatures is eye of terror.
    The central body of a death kiss has no mouth. Its central eye gives it 120-foot infravision, but the death kiss has no magical powers. A death kiss is 90% likely to be taken for a beholder when sighted. The 10 tentacles largely retract into the body when not needed, resembling eyestalks, but can lash out to a full 20-foot stretch with blinding speed. The tentacles may act separately or in concert, attacking a single creature or an entire adventuring company.
    A tentacle's initial strike does 1-8 points of damage as the barb-mouthed tip attaches to the victim. Each attached tentacle drains 2 hit points worth of blood per round, beginning the round after it hits.
    Like the beholder, the death kiss has variable Armor Classes. In ordinary combat, use the following table, though situations may dictate other methods (should the creature be attacking with a tentacle from 20 feet away, then no attack on the body or central eye may be made, while attacks on the stalk and mouth are still possible).
    Roll  Locatio        AC Hit Points
    01-75 Body           4  77-84
    76-85 Central Eye    8  6
    86-95 Tentacle stalk 2  6
    96-00 Tentacle mouth 4  See following text
    A hit on a tentacle-mouth inflicts no damage, but stuns the tentacle, causing it to writhe helplessly for 1-4 rounds. If its central eye is destroyed, a bleeder locates beings within 10 feet by smell and sensing vibrations, but it is otherwise unaffected.
    Tentacles must be struck with edged weapons to injure them. They can be torn free from the victim by a successful bend bars/lift gates roll. Such a forceful removal does the victim 1-6 damage per tentacle, since the barbed teeth are violently torn free from the tentacle.
    If an attached tentacle is damaged but not destroyed, it instantly and automatically drains sufficient hit points, in blood, from the victim's body to restore it to a full 6 hit points. This reflex effect occurs after every non-killing hit on a tentacle, even if it is wounded more than once in a round. This cannot occur more than twice in one round. The parasitic healing effect does not respond to damage suffered by the central body or other tentacles.
    A tentacle continues to drain blood, if it was draining when the central body of the death kiss reaches 0 hit points. Tentacles not attached to a victim at that time are incapable of further activity. A death kiss can retract a draining tentacle, but voluntarily does so only when its central body is at 5 hit points or less; it willfully detaches once the victim has been drained to 0 hit points.
    Ingested blood is used to generate electrical energy â€“ 1 hit point of blood becomes 1 charge. A death kiss uses this energy for motor activity and healing. An eye of terror expends one charge every two turns in moving, and thus is almost constantly hunting prey. Spending one charge enables a bleeder to heal 1 hit point of damage to each of its 10 tentacles, its central body, and its eye (12 hit points in all). It can heal itself with one charge of stored energy every other round in addition to its normal attacks and activity.
    Each tentacle can store up to 24 charges of drained energy, the body capable of storing 50 charges of drained energy. A severed tentacle is 70% likely to discharge its cumulative charges, when severed, into anything touching it; each charge delivers 1 hit point of electrical damage.
    Finally, bleeders can ram opponents with their mass. This attack does 1-8 damage.
    A death kiss may "shut itself down", remaining motionless and insensitive on the ground, and can remain alive in that state for long periods of time. To awaken from its hibernation, the creature requires an influx of electrical energy, considerable heat, or the internal shock caused by a blow, fall, wound, or magical attack; any of the above stimulants must deal at least 5 points of damage to the death kiss to awaken it. Adventurers finding a hibernating death kiss usually provide such stimulation, thinking the sleeper helpless prey.
    Eyes of terror are solitary hunters, fully inheriting the paranoia and ego of their cousins, the beholders. If they encounter one of their kin, the result is often a mid-air struggle to the death. The loser's body becomes an incubator and breeding ground for the death kiss' offspring. Within one day, 1-4 young will "hatch". Each new bleeder has half its parent's hit points, and fully matures in 1 month.
    The death kiss has an organ in the central, upper body that is a valued ingredient in magical potions and spell inks concerned with levitation (and may be sold like beholder eyes). In addition, a brain or nerve node deep in a bleeder's body hardens into a soft-sided, faceted red gem upon the creature's death. Called "bloodeyes", these typically fetch a market price of 70 gp each. They are valued for adornments since they glow more brightly as the wearer's emotions intensify.
  Eye of the Deep (Beholder-kin): |
    This is a water breathing version of the beholder, and dwells only at great depths, floating slowly about, stalking prey. They have two crab-like pincers which inflict 2-8 (2d4) points of damage each, and a wide mouth full of sharp teeth that does 1-6 points of damage.
    The primary weapons of the eyes of the deep, however, are their eyes. The creature's large central eye emits a cone of blinding light 5 feet wide at its start, 30 feet long, and 20 feet wide at its base. Those in the cone must save vs. poison or be stunned for 2-8 (2d4) rounds.
    The eye of the deep also has two smaller eyes on long stalks, and uses both to create illusion. Acting independently, the small eyes are able to cast hold perso and hold monster spells respectively.
    The eye of the deep has an Armor Class of 5 everywhere, including its eyes and eye stalks. If its eyestalks are severed they will grow back in about a week.
  Gauth (Beholder-kin): |
    The Gauth is a relative of the beholder that feeds on magic. Its spherical body is 5 feet in diameter and brown in color, mottled with purple and gray. Located in the center of the gauth's forward hemisphere is a large central eye surrounded by a ring of smaller eyes that are protected by ridges of tough flesh. These secondary body eyes provide the creature with normal vision in lighted areas and infravision to 90 feet. On the underside is the beast's fearsome mouth with its accompanying cluster of four feeding tendrils, while the top is adorned with a crown of six eye stalks. Attacks on the creature hit as follows:
    Roll  Locatio          AC Hit Points
    01-85 Body             0  As listed
    86-90 Central Eye      7  Part of Body
    91-00 Eyestalk/Tendril 2  6 hit points
    While the gauth is similar to the beholder, its ability to feed on the energy of magical objects makes it even more dangerous in some ways.
    When a gauth moves into combat, it begins to glow, much as if it were the object of a faerie fire spell, to attract the attention of its foes. A creature that meets the gaze of the central eye must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell, with a -2 penalty, or be affected as if the victim of a feeblemind spell.
    If a gauth chooses to bite with its great maw, the sharp fangs inflict 3d4 points of damage. The four tendrils around the mouth can grab and hold victims as if they had a Strength of 18, but they can inflict no damage.
    A gauth in combat can also employ its six eye stalks. These eyes have the following powers:
    1. Cause serious wounds (as spell, 30-foot range)
    2. Repulsio (as spell, 10-foot wide path, 40-foot range)
    3. Cone of cold (as spell, inflicts 3d4 points of damage and has an area of effect 5 feet wide at the start, 50 feet long, and 20 feet wide at the base; this eye can be used only three times per day)
    4. Lightning bolt (as spell, inflicts 4d4 damage with 80' range; this power can be used up to four times per day)
    5. Paralyzatio (as wand, 40-foot range, single target; only a dispel magic or the beholder's death can free the victim)
    6. Dweomer drai (see below)
    Perhaps the most feared of the gauth's powers, its dweomer drai , permits the gauth to drain charges from magical items. It has a 40-foot range and can be targeted on one individual per round. In addition to preventing one object from functioning for the duration of that round, this power drains one charge from one charged object. Permanent objects, such as magical swords, are rendered powerless for one round by this ability. Artifacts are not affected by the dweomer drai . The eye has no effect on spells that have been memorized (but not yet cast) and it will not break the concentration of a wizard. It does neutralize any spell cast by its target that round, however.
    A dispel magic spell cast on any of the gauth's eye stalks prevents its use for 1d4 rounds. The central eye, any fully retracted eye stalks, the body's ability to glow, and the gauth's natural levitatio are not subject to injury by such a spell.
    If a gauth is slain, its magical energy dissipates. Usually, this is a harmless event, but there is a 2% chance that it is catastrophic, inflicting 4d4 points of damage to all creatures within 10 feet (no saving throw). Gauth are immune to their own powers and to those of other gauth. They have an unusual physiology that enables them to regenerate 1 hit point every two turns.
    Although gauth are not known to fight over territories or prey, they do go to great lengths to avoid each other. Even when they encounter another of their kind in the wilderness, they often ignore them utterly.
    A gauth can survive by eating meat but it greatly prefers to devour magical objects. In some unknown manner, the creature is able to absorb magical energy and feed on it. Each turn that an object spends in the gauth's stomach causes it to lose one charge. A permanent object is rendered inoperative after one day (artifacts are not affected, nor do they provide sustenance). Magical objects that cannot be entirely digested by a gauth are spat out after they have been drained of all their power.
    Gauth are thought to live a century or so. Within a week of their "natural" death, two young gauth emerge from the corpse. Although smaller than their parent (each has 2+2 or 3+3 HD and a bite that causes only 2d4 points of damage), they have all the powers of a full-grown adult.
  Orbus: |
    The orbus is either a genetically bred or a stunted and immature form of the standard beholder. It is only found in space aboard the tyrant ships of the beholder nations. It is chalk-white and lacks functioning smaller eyes. The central eye is huge and vulnerable, occupying most of the upper body above a small, toothless mouth. This eye has the normal anti-magic properties, but is milky white.
    Despite their vulnerability, the orbi are the means by which the beholders travel through space. It is they that can funnel the magical energies of the other beholders into motive force â€“ they are living spelljammer helms . There are 1-5 of them aboard any tyrant ship, and they are located closest to the hive mother , at the deepest point of the shell.
    The orbi have their hit points distributed as common beholders: one third for the central eye and two thirds for the body. However, when attacking an orbus, 50% of the hits will strike the central eye, the remainder hitting the body. Both eye and body have the same Armor Class.
  Spectator (Beholder-kin): |
    Another relative of the beholder, the spectator is a guardian of places and treasures, and capable of limited planar travel. Once it is given a task, the spectator will watch for up to 101 years. It will allow no one to use, borrow, or examine an item or treasure, except the one who gave it its orders. The spectator has a large central eye and four smaller eye stalks protruding from the top of its hovering, spherical body.
    The spectator is difficult to surprise, and has a +2 surprise modifier and a +1 initiative modifier. It is basically a passive creature, and will attempt to communicate and implant suggestion as its first act, unless it is immediately attacked.
    Striking a spectator has the following effects:
    Roll  Locatio      AC Hit Points
    01-70 Body         4  4+4 HD
    71-90 Eyestalk/Eye 7  1 hit point
    91-00 Central Eye  7  1 hit point
    A spectator, if blinded in all of its eyes, cannot defend its treasure and will teleport to the outer plane of Nirvana. This is the only condition under which it will leave its post. Its eyes regenerate in one day and then it returns. If the treasure is gone, the creature again leaves for Nirvana, never to return.
    The spectator has a general magic resistance of 5%. As long as the central eye is undamaged, it can also reflect one spell cast at it, per round, sending it back against the caster. This does not apply to spells whose range is touch. Reflection occurs only if the spectator rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw fails, magic resistance (and a further saving throw) must be rolled. Reflection is possible only if the caster is standing within the 60 degree arc of the central eye. Only the spellcaster is affected by a reflected spell.
    All of the smaller eyes may be used at the same time against the same target. Their powers are:
    1. Create food and water (creates the amount of food and water for a large meal for up to six people; this takes one full round)
    2. Cause serious wounds (inflicts 2d8+3 points of damage to a single being at a range of 60 yards; a saving throw vs. spell is allowed for half damage)
    3. Paralyzation ray (range 90 feet, one target only, for 8d4 rounds).
    4. Telepathy (range 120 feet, only one target; communication is possible in this way, and the beast can also plant a suggestio if the target fails a saving throw vs. spell; the suggestion is always to leave in peace).
    If properly met, the spectator can be quite friendly. It will tell a party exactly what it is guarding early in any conversation. If its charge is not threatened, it can be very amiable and talkative, using its telepathy.
    Spectators move by a very rapid levitation, in any direction. They will drift aimlessly when asleep (20% likely when encountered), never touching the ground.
    The treasure being guarded is 90% likely to be a magical item. If the spectator gains incidental treasure while performing its duty, this is not part of its charge and it will freely allow it to be taken. Incidental treasure can be generated as follows: 40% for 3-300 coins of mixed types, 30% for 1d6 gems of 50 gp base value, 20% for 1d4 potions, 15% for a +1 piece of armor, 15% for a +1 weapon, and 5% for a miscellaneous magical item valued at 1,000 XP or less.
    Spectators are summoned from Nirvana by casting monster summoning V with material components of three or more small eyes from a beholder. (The chance of success is 10% per eye.) The spectator can be commanded only to guard some treasure. It performs no other duty, and if commanded to undertake some other task, it returns to Nirvana immediately. If its guarded treasure is ever destroyed or stolen, the spectator is released from service and returns to Nirvana. The summoner may take the item with no interference from the spectator, but this releases the creature.
  Undead Beholder (Death Tyrant): |
    Death tyrants are rotting, mold-encrusted beholders. They may be shriveled, wounds exposing their internal, spherical networks of circular ribs, among the remnants of their exoskeletal plates. All sport wounds, some have eyestalks missing, or a milky film covering their eyes. They move and turn more slowly than living beholders, striking and bringing their eyes to bear last in any combat round.
    An undead beholder can use all the powers of its surviving eyes, just as it did in life. The powers of 2-5 eyes (select randomly, including the central eye) are lost due to injuries or death, and the change to undeath. Although a death tyrant heals its motive energies through time, it cannot regenerate lost eyestalks or their powers.
    Charm powers are lost in undeath. The two eyes that charmed either become useless (60%), or function as weak hold monster effects (40%). A being failing to save against such a hold remains held as long as the eye's gaze remains steadily focused on them. If the eye is turned on another being, or the victim hooded, or forcibly removed, the hold lasts another 1-3 rounds. Death tyrants are immune to sleep , charm , and hold spells.
    If not controlled by another creature through magic, a death tyrant hangs motionless until its creator's instructions are fulfilled (for example, "Attack all humans who enter this chamber until they are destroyed or flee. Do not leave the chamber.") If no instructions are given to a "new" death tyrant, it attacks all living things it perceives. Death tyrants occur spontaneously in very rare instances. In most cases, they are created through the magic of evil beings â€“ from human mages to illithid villains. Some outcast, magic-using beholders have even been known to create death tyrants from their own unfortunate brethren.
    Death tyrants have no self-awareness or social interaction; they are mindless servants of more powerful masters. "Mindless" is a relative term; the once highly intelligent brains of death tyrants still use eyes skillfully to perceive and attack nearby foes. When a death tyrant is controlled by another being, consider it to have the intelligence of its controller.
    Death tyrants are created from dying beholders. A spell, thought to have been developed by human mages in the remote past, forces a beholder from a living to an undead state, and imprints its brain with instructions. "Rogue" death tyrants also exist: those whose instructions specifically enable them to ignore all controlling attempts. These are immune to the control attempts of all other beings. Beholders often leave them as traps against rivals.
    Human spell researchers report that control of a death tyrant is very difficult. A beholder's mind fluctuates wildly in the frequency and level of its mental activity, scrambling normal charm monster and control undead spells. A special spell must be devised to command a death tyrant.
  Saving Throws: |
    Most beholders make saving throws according to their Hit Dice. The Death Kiss makes saving throws as a 10th-level warrior. The typical beholder and undead beholders make saving throws as follows:
    Creature hit points Saves as
    45-49               10th level warrior
    50-59               12th level warrior
    60-69               14th level warrior
    70+                 16th level warrior

  Hive Mother (Beholder-kin): |
    The legendary hive mothers are also called the "Ultimate tyrants", or just "Ultimates". They are twice the size of typical beholders , and differ in appearance as well.
    Their mouths are larger, so large that they can gulp down a man-sized target on a natural die roll of 20. Once swallowed, the prey takes 5-20 points of damage (5d4) each round until it is dead or escapes. The beholder's mouth is not very deep, so a victim can escape by making a successful attack roll.
    The ultimate has no eyestalks, but its magical eyes are protected by hooded covers in the flesh of the creature's body, so that they cannot be severed. The central eye has 15 hit points.
    Roll  Locatio     AC Hit Points
    01-90 Body        0  20 HD
    91-00 Central Eye 7  15 hp
    The ultimate's true ability is in controlling the actions of large numbers of beholders and beholder-kin. A hive mother may have 5-10 ordinary beholders under its command, or 5-20 abomination or beholder-kin (see below), which it communicates with telepathically. A nesting hive mother spells disaster for the surrounding region, as it can apparently create a community of beholders, beholder-kin, and abominations. If destroyed, the beholders and beholder-kin will turn on each other, or seek their own lairs.
    Hive mothers may be the ancestral stock of the better known beholder, the next step of its evolution, a magical mutation, or a separate species. The reality remains unknown.
  Director (Abomination): |
    Directors are a social, warrior-beholder, and breed specialized mounts. They mindlink with their mounts to better control them.
    Directors resemble beholders, but their central eye is smaller. They possess only six small eyes on retractable eye stalks. Directors have a fanged mouth below the central eye and possesses three clawed, sensory tendrils on their ventral surface. These tendrils are used to cling to the mount and link with its limited mind.
    Directors' eyes have their own powers:
    1. Magic Missile (as spell, 2/round)
    2. Burning Hands (as spell at 8th level)
    3. Wall of Ice (as spell)
    4. Slow (as spell)
    5. Enervation (as spell)
    6. Improved Phantasmal Force (as spell)
    A director's central eye has the power of deflection â€“ all frontal attacks on director suffer a -2 penalty to the attack roll and damage is halved. The director also gains a +2 bonus to all saving throws against spells cast by those in the field of vision of the central eye.
    Director mounts seem to have derived from an insect stock, as they are covered in chitin and have simple eye spots and multiple limbs.
    Directors normally possess 8 Hit Dice, but when mounted the director and mount are treated as a single creature whose Hit Dice equals the sum of those of the director and the mount. After a director/mount suffers half damage, the mount's speed is reduced to half and the director gets only one physical attack per round. A director may flee and leave his mount to fend for itself (the mount suffers a -4 penalty to its attack rolls). Directors have an AC of 4, but are AC 2 when mounted. Directors may use all of their normal powers while mounted, within the restrictions of beholder targeting angles.
    Crawler (a typical mount): A crawler resembles a cross between a centipede and a spider. It has 4 Hit Dice. It has 10 legs, two pairs of frontal antennae, and two fighting spider fangs that can be used for separate stabbing attacks causing 2d4 points of damage each. Victims who fail to roll successful saving throws vs. poison are paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. Crawlers are omnivores that prefer to eat smaller creatures. Unmounted, they may roll into a ball to gain an AC of 0. They have cutting mandibles beneath their front fangs.
  Examiner (Abomination): |
    An examiner is a 4-foot diameter sphere with no central eye and only four small eyes, each at the end of an antenna, mounted atop the sphere. They have one small, lamprey-like mouth on their ventral surface. The mouth is surrounded by four multi-jointed limbs ending in gripper pads. These limbs can pick up and manipulate tools, the chief strength of the examiner.
    Examiners are scholars and clerks involved in spell and magical item enhancement, research, and creation. They can use any artifact or tool as well as humans , and they can wield up to four items at a time. Examiners regenerate 1 point of damage each round. The powers of their four eyes are given below (all spell-like effects are cast at the 8th level).
    1. Enlarge or Reduce
    2. Identify or Legend Lore
    3. Transmute Form (similar to a Stone Shape spell, but works on all types of nonmagical, nonliving material)
    4. Spell Reflectio as a ring of spell turning
    Examiners are not the bravest of beholder-kin, but they are potentially the most dangerous with their command of artifacts. They are often the lackeys of beholders, overseers, and hive mothers.
  Lensman (Abomination): |
    A lensman has one eye set in the chest of its five-limbed, starfish-shaped, simian body. Beneath the eye is a leering, toothy maw. Four of the five limbs end in three-fingered, two-thumbed, clawed hands. The fifth limb, atop the body, is a prehensile, whip-like tentacle. Its chitin is soft and there are many short, fly-like hairs. Lensmen are the only kin to wear any sort of garb â€“ a webbing that is used to hold tools and weapons. Their preferred weapons are double-headed pole arms.
    Lensmen are semi-mindless drones that don't question their lot in life. The eye of each lensman possesses only one of the following six special powers (all at the 6th level of ability).
    1. Emotio
    2. Heal
    3. Dispel Magic
    4. Tongues
    5. Phantasmal Force
    6. Protections (as scrolls, any type, but only one at a time)
  Overseer (Abomination): |
    Overseers resemble fleshy trees. They have 13 limbs, each of which ends in a bud that conceals an eye; one of these limbs forms the top spine, and three yammering mouths surround the spine. There are eight thorny, vine-like limbs that are used to grasp tools and for physical defense, inflicting 1d10+2 points of damage each. Overseers sit on root-like bases and can inch along when movement is required. They cannot levitate.
    Overseers are covered with a fungus which changes color as the overseers desire, commonly mottled green, gray, and brown.
    Overseers may use any physical weapons or artifacts. The powers of their 13 eyes are as follows (all magical effects are cast at 14th level).
    1. Cone of Cold
    2. Dispel Magic
    3. Paralysis
    4. Chain Lightning
    5. Telekinesis 250 lb. weight
    6. Emotio
    7. Mass Charm
    8. Domination
    9. Mass Suggestio
    10. Major Creatio
    11. Spell Turning
    12. Serten's Spell Immunity
    13. Temporal Stasis
    An overseer's AC is 2, but each eye stalk is AC 7 and is severed if it suffers 10 points of damage. Like hive mothers (that operate with them), overseers can convince similar beholders and beholder-kin to work together. Overseers are very protective of their health and always have one or two beholder guards and at least a half dozen directors protecting their welfare.
  Watcher (Abomination): |
    Watchers are 6-foot-diameter spheres with three central eyes arranged around the circumference of the sphere. These eyes are huge and unlidded. On the crown of the sphere is a compound eye and a ring of six eye spots that make it difficult to surprise a watcher. A large tentacle with a barbed prehensile pad extends from the ventral surface, right behind the small mouth with its rasp-like tongue. Watchers feed on carrion and stunned prey. They are information gatherers and are the least brave of all the eye tyrant races.
    Watchers can attack with their single tentacle for 3d6 points of damage. The tentacle also inflicts an electrical shock; victims who fail a system shock roll fall unconscious.
    Each of a watcher's main eyes has two powers, and the compound eye on top may draw on three different abilities. The six eye spots have no special powers.
    1. True Seeing and ESP
    2. Advanced Illusion and Demi-Shadow Magic
    3. Telekinesis 1,000 lb. and Teleport
    Compound Eye: Message , Tongues , and Suggestio
    Watchers are not aggressive warriors; they prefer misdirection and flight to actual confrontation.

  Description: |
    Bionoids are chitinous, bipedal humanoid insects with a glowing circular gem in the center of their forehead. Though their appearance strikes fear in those who view them, their demeanor belies their looks. They originated as "Living Weapons" during the Unhuman Wars.
    In their combat form, also called their monster form, they are tall, muscular creatures with iridescent exoskeletons. Hard clawlike blades protrude from both forearms and the head. In addition to the standard pair of compound eyes, they possess four secondary eyes that can move independently like those of a chameleon. Pebbly, metallic-looking muscle fibers are visible at the joints.
    In their humanoid form, bionoids are thin, well-muscled, and fairly tall. They have uniformly calm, even tempers, and are often contemplative. They move with great economy; useless gestures or movements are very rare.
  Combat: |
    In battle, the bionoids' true nature becomes apparent. They make two slashing attacks with their forearm blades for 1d10 points of damage apiece, along with spiked fists that strike for 1d8. Similarly, the bionoid's feet have a heel spur that does 2d8 points of damage in a kick or stomp attack. It can make two kicks per round. The bionoid's chitinous plates and its agility give it AC -3.
    Due to their high speed, bionoids usually use their fists, forearms and feet in combination with a leaping attack that brings them immediately into close striking range. In close combat with large opponents, the bionoid also crushes the opponent in its arms for an additional 2d8 points of damage. This damage continues on each round the opponent is crushed.
    The bionoids' specialized halberds do 1d12 points of damage (plus strength bonuses of +6); only bionoids can wield them. These weapons, pointed with blades at each end, can attack a single target three times per round. The bionoids' speed, agility and expertise with these traditional specialty weapons make them a most feared opponent.
    The bionoid's most powerful weapon is a spell-like effect similar to the third level fireball spell. The bionoid opens up the twin dorsal plates on its chest, exposing two highly charged membranes. Opening these chest plates causes 2d4 points of damage to the bionoid itself, while causing damage as a 6th-level fireball spell in a 30' cone shape. The damage to the bionoid means this attack is a last resort. The warrior must rest for a full day after such a discharge before using it again.
    The crystal eye on its forehead is the bionoid's weak point. The eye remains in the center of the bionoid's forehead when in monster-form, but is hidden inside the skull in human form. Removal of the crystal eye results in the bionoid's immediate decomposition. The crystal eye traps its master's essence to wait for regeneration. If a direct crushing blow shatters the eye, irrevocable death for eye and bionoid ensues.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Bionoids were originally tailored as troops in the Unhuman Wars. Volunteer elves gave themselves to be altered into organic fighting machine. After the Wars, they were cast out into the cosmos, to make their own way far from the sight of the elves. Years of ostracism, of living apart from the rest of elvish society like plague victims, has instilled in them a deep distrust of all other elven races.
    Although these bionoids were instilled with an instinctive urge for combat without quarter, they are essentially good beings who constantly strive to control the powers of their implanted nature.
    Though they travel nearly everywhere in wildspace , bionoids prefer to remain alone. Many work as crew members on spelljamming ships across the flow , or they reside in country manors or castles. Still others live as hermits on lonely asteroids far from the normal spelljamming trade routes. In some cases, elvish communities sympathetic to the bionoids' situation have taken in individual bionoids.
    Though rare, a bionoid family can comprise hundreds of members, always led by the individual who started the unit, either the original bionoid or its full-blooded descendants. Bionoid symbionts are welcome to join the unit, but must vow to avoid (and avoid infecting) residents of the outside world.
    Though engineered for warfare, the family unit sustains itself primarily through farming. They practice battle skills primarily as a spiritual discipline. Most frontier cities and spelljamming outposts welcome bionoid communities.
  Ecology: |
    Even bionoid reproduction is invasive. The eggs of mature bionoids are disc-shaped with a single crystalline trigger in the center. This crystal serves a multiple purpose: it is an attractant to potential victims since it makes the egg look like a magical item, and it is also the young bionoid's eye. When a potential host touches the crystal eye, the host's essence marks the egg. The egg bursts, attaches to the host, and grows as a symbiont, eventually separating and becoming a separate, nymph bionoid.
    If a orc touches the egg, the egg explodes in a mass of corrosive filaments causing immediate death. A successful saving throw versus spell causes 2d12 hit points of corrosive damage. If half-orcs make their saving throws, the half-orc and the bionoid bind in symbiosis. Evil beings can fuse with the bionoid, but suffer the penalties of radical change to the bionoid's good alignment.
    If elves, humans or other humanoid races touch the egg, it infiltrates the victim, creating another adult bionoid. The new bionoid has the abilities described above, but appears only when danger threatens, whereupon the host monsters out into the bionoid monster form. In addition, the symbiosis gives the host a natural AC of 7. But the host should only wear normal, easily replaceable clothing, due to the unpredictable nature of his malady!
    The crystal eye 's AC is 0, it has 45 hit points, and it is worth around 10,000 gp â€“ but woe betide the buyer! In the crystal eye is the essence of the original owner. If presented with a living body, the crystal reduces and restructures that body in favor of its stored master, resulting in death (of a sort) for the purchaser.

  Description: |
    Blazozoids resemble huge, white elmari or small comets of creamy white flame. Their spherical bodies consist entirely of fiery plasma gas, though they often drag a tail of blue fire behind them when traveling at spelljammer speeds.
    Blazozoids are sentient balls of living energy with the ability to communicate telepathically. They are always encountered in wildspace , never on planets or i the phlogisto . Their fiery bodies are so hot that they burn up any matter (including air and water) that they contact (see the explanation of "firetouch" below). In addition, their superheated bodies ignite any phlogiston within a hundred feet of them. Should a blazozoid be foolish enough to expose itself to the phlogiston ocean, the resulting explosion vaporizes everything within a mile, including the blazozoid. (Affected characters must roll successful saving throws vs. dragon breath to survive. Items and beings are thrown 1d10 miles away from the center of the explosion and suffer 1d10 points of damage for each mile thrown.)
  Combat: |
    Blazozoids usually ignore passing spelljammer ships unless bothered in some way. However, blazozoids do approach ships when they want one of two things: either a ride through the phlogiston or a meal. If the party refuses to give the blazozoid a ride, or if it is searching for a meal, it attacks.
    Blazozoids attack by ramming into their target, whether it is an individual or an entire ship. The initial impact causes 8d6 points of damage. The blazozoid then tries to remain in contact with the target, using its firetouch to consume it. Any living victim touched by a blazozoid must roll a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon or burst into flames, suffering 5d6 points of damage each round he remains in contact with the blazozoid. Those attempting to escape a blazozoid's grasp must roll a successful Dexterity check. Inanimate objects touched by a blazozoid must roll a successful saving throw vs. magical fire or burst into flames, suffering an additional 3d6 points of damage per round until removed from contact with the blazozoid and the fire is extinguished.
    Blazozoids are immune to fire damage, whether magical or normal. In addition, any weapon that strikes a blazozoid and fails a saving throw vs. normal fire is destroyed by the heat (although the weapon still inflicts full damage). Weapons with a bonus of +3 or more are immune to this effect. Cold-and water-based attacks have their normal effects on blazozoids.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Blazozoids are the progeny of a huge, living star. Like the blazozoids themselves, this star consists of living energy. Unfortunately, this star, which refers to itself as " I ", does not recognize material beings as alive, much less intelligent. Therefore, it believes itself to be the only sentient being in the universe. To determine whether this is true, I has formed millions of emissaries from its own body and dispatched them to the far ends of the universe in search of another living star.
    The blazozoids are these emissaries. Although intelligent, they are completely incapable of altering the basic beliefs that I imprinted upon them at their creation. Therefore, they do not believe that material beings, such as the PCs, are truly intelligent. Instead, they view material beings as potential food sources, or, at best, as a means of transport across the phlogiston.
  Ecology: |
    Blazozoids cannot reproduce and must be created from I â€™s body. They eat, or refuel, by turning matter into energy. Since their bodies are made entirely of energy, a well-fed blazozoid may be as much as 60 feet across, while one that has not eaten in some time may be less than 10 feet across (a starving blazozoid also has a slightly yellow tinge to its flame).
    When encountered in the depths of wildspace (i.e., close to a crystal sphere ), a blazozoid is sure to want something from a passing spelljammer ship â€“ either to eat the ship and crew, or to convince the pilots to take it to the next crystal sphere. Often, the blazozoid will agree to perform some service in return for its passage. However, if some provision for feeding the blazozoid during the long journey is not made, it may turn on the crew after reaching the next crystal sphere. To transport a blazozoid across the phlogiston, the blazozoid must be completely encased in some sort of flame-proof container, such as iron, stone, or force. Simply stowing them below decks will have disastrous effects when the ship enters the phlogiston.

  Description: |
    Bloodsacs (technically known as "haagathga") are blob-like bloodsuckers that silently glide through wildspace looking for blood. This usually means spelljamming ships, with their complements of warm-blooded sailors.
    These space-borne horrors are shapeless, pulsating sacks of fluid in a slightly translucent black-blue membrane. This membrane is covered by tiny, razor-rimmed suckers, each with tiny speck of silver or yellow coloring. Bloodsacs resemble a patch of flying night sky. The familiar smell of blood wafts about their bodies.
    Bloodsacs travel in packs, using their natural camouflage to swoop down on unsuspecting ships, surprising the crews, and draining their blood. The beasts are sometime called "star vampires". They have no speech.
  Combat: |
    Bloodsacs move silently through space using infravision to detect warm-blooded victims. They glide noiselessly onto the deck of a spelljamming vessel, probably one in orbit around a planet , and try to surprise sailors on deck. Due to the creatures' coloration, foes suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. Guards have a 1% chance per point of Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever is higher) to spot the swarm. Guards only get one chance to spot the bloodsacs before the monsters attack.
    If at all possible, bloodsacs attack from behind, gaining a +2 to their attack rolls.
    Once a victim is hit, the bloodsac's tiny suckers bore into the skin and begin sucking out the blood, causing 2d10 damage. Once attached, a bloodsac does not let go until pulled off, or until it drains the victim completely. Pulling off a bloodsac requires a Strength ability check. If the beast comes off, the victim takes an additional 1d10 points of damage as the blob's suckers tear out of the victim's flesh. If the blob remains attached, it automatically does 2d10 points of damage each round (no attack roll needed). As the bloodsac drains blood from its victim, its color changes from dark blue to a sickly violet.
    After draining a victim, the bloodsac sprouts a tube and attaches it to the base of the victim's skull. Through this tube the blob drains out the victim's brain fluids. This process takes one round, after which the bloodsac flies away, sated â€“ for now.
    The fluid it collects contains the victim's memories and knowledge. Thus, victims raised from the dead have no memory of their identities and, though they have full hit points, are effectively 0-level characters in skills, THAC0, saving throws, and proficiencies. All memories are lost. Victims still retain basic skills needed to take care of everyday needs, as well as the ability to speak one language (most likely Common).
    A spell such as restoratio or a wish can restore lost memory; so can catching the bloodsac who drained the fluid and pouring it over the victim before he is raised from the dead.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Bloodsac swarms have no leader. They merely follow whomever has homed in on food. They wander wildspace, never sleeping, never setting up a lair nor landing on a planet. Bloodsacs hate gravity, for their bodies collapse into sluggish heaps of protoplasm.

    Bloodsacs are parasitic predators, greatly feared by warm-blooded beings of all alignments and races. They reproduce by laying a clutch of 6d6 eggs inside a victim who has been completely drained of blood. For each bloodsac that has killed a victim, there is a 50% chance that it was a female and has laid eggs in the victim's body. The eggs hatch 2d6 days later, bursting the body asunder and releasing the voraciously hungry bloodsac young (1 HD each, 1d8 blood drain damage per round).
    Mind flayers take an interest in the bloodsacs, especially with the blobs' ability to drain brain fluids. Some mind flayers keep trained bloodsacs, a particularly deadly combination.

  Description: |
    A creation of the ancient race of mind flayers, brain golems may be the most horrible of all their kind. They exist purely for the desire of illithids and are unswayed from their goals.
    A brain golem appears as a huge, burly humanoid with an oversized brain for a head. In fact, the whole body is made up of brain tissue, but is covered with a thin film of slimy skin.
    Although brain golems are more intelligent than other golems, they are completely unable to communicate.
  Combat: |
    Brain golems are used as muscle or guards for illithids, and they attack an opponent only if so ordered or if the opponent tries to get at what the brain golem is guarding. Regardless of the situation, brain golems never attack mind flayers, which limits their effectiveness in battles between members of that race.
    In combat, brain golems are more aware of their environment than other golems. They always aim for wizards first, knowing that a quick strike could easily kill a member of that physically weak class. They seem to have an innate ability to roughly determine an opponent's condition (i.e., hit points), so they can continue to aim for the next weakest character after defeating a wizard.
    A brain golem's physical attack is a swift punch with its fist. It is unable to employ both fists in a round because of its singular thought pattern, but the one fist is often good enough. In addition, once per turn, a brain golem can release a form of the mind flayer's mental blast. This energy strikes everyone within 60 feet. All those hit must make successful saving throws vs. spell or suffer 2d8 points of damage and become stunned for 1d10 rounds. Those who do save only lose initiative for the next round and suffer 1d8 damage. The golem generally calls upon this attack if reduced to 15 hp or less, or if ordered to do so by a mind flayer.
    Like all golems, brain golems are immune to all forms of poison and cannot be affected by mind-influencing spells such as charms or illusions. They are also immune to death magic.
  Habitat/Society: |
    In a book by a sage called Hapworth is a tale told by two rescued huma prisoners of the illithids, who apparently saw a brain golem created. Although the magic used was unknown to the humans, the brain golem's body seemed to be a combination of different racial brains. As for the head, this was taken from a part of the elder brain of the mind flayers. The skin was a membrane oozed from that same being.
    Mind flayers use brain golems as they use all slaves: as heavy guards, used against monsters resistant to mind attacks or the physical attacks of the illithids. In addition, they are used to perform tasks that are beneath mind flayers, such as guarding food stocks and slaves, etc. Because of their undying loyalty and obedience, the mind flayers prefer brain golems over other races or constructs. A cynical phrase used by the githzerai, "treated like a brain golem," means to be treated well by a slave master.
    No city or community of mind flayers will have more than 25 such golems, probably because the illithids don't want to take too much tissue from their beloved elder brain.
  Ecology: |
    Except in the services of their masters, brain golems have no place in any ecology. However, parts of them are useful in the manufacture of mind-affecting magical items (according to Sage Hapworth, at least).

  Description: |
    Bugbears are giant, hairy cousins of goblins who frequent the same areas as their smaller relatives.
    Bugbears are large and very muscular, standing 7' tall. Their hides range from light yellow to yellow brown and their thick coarse hair varies in color from brown to brick red. Though vaguely humanoid in appearance, bugbears seem to contain the blood of some large carnivore. Their eyes recall those of some savage bestial animal, being greenish white with red pupils, while their ears are wedge shaped, rising from the top of their heads. A bugbear's mouth is full of long sharp fangs.
    Bugbears have a nose much like that of a bear with the same fine sense of smell. It is this feature which earned them their name, despite the fact that they are not actually related to bears in any way. Their tough leathery hide and long sharp nails also look something like those of a bear, but are far more dexterous.
    The typical bugbear's sight and hearing are exceptional, and they can move with amazing agility when the need arises. Bugbear eyesight extends somewhat into the infrared, giving them infravision out to 60 feet.
    The bugbear language is a foul sounding mixture of gestures, grunts, and snarls which leads many to underestimate the intelligence of these creatures. In addition, most bugbears can speak the language of goblins and hobgoblins.
  Combat: |
    Whenever possible, bugbears prefer to ambush their foes. They impose a -3 on others' surprise rolls.
    If a party looks dangerous, bugbear scouts will not hesitate to fetch reinforcements. A bugbear attack will be tactically sound, if not brilliant. They will hurl small weapons, such as maces, hammers, and spears before closing with their foes. If they think they are outnumbered or overmatched, bugbears will retreat, preferring to live to fight another day.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Bugbears prefer to live in caves and in underground locations. A lair may consist of one large cavern or a group of caverns. They are well-adapted to this life, since they operate equally well in daylight and darkness.
    If a lair is uncovered and 12 or more bugbears are encountered they will have a leader. These individuals have between 22 and 25 hit points, an Armor Class of 4, and attack as 4 Hit Die monsters. Their great strength gives them a +3 to all damage inflicted in melee combat.
    If 24 or more bugbears are encountered, they will have a chief in addition to their leaders. Chiefs have between 28 and 30 hit points, an Armor Class of 3, and attack as 4 Hit Die monsters. Chiefs are so strong that they gain a +4 bonus to all damage caused in melee. Each chief will also have a sub-chief who is identical to the leaders described above.
    In a lair, half of the bugbears will be females and young who will not fight except in a life or death situation. They are never forced into combat, instead being trained and indoctrinated into Bugbear society (in the case of young) or preforming domestic work (in the case of females) for the majority of their lives.
    The species survives primarily by hunting. They have no compunctions about eating anything they can kill, including humans , goblins, and any monsters smaller than themselves. They are also fond of wine and strong ale, often drinking to excess.
    Bugbears are territorial, and the size of the domains vary with the size of the group and its location. It may be several square miles in the wilderness, or a narrow, more restricted area in an underground region.
    Intruders are considered a valuable source of food and treasure, and bugbears rarely negotiate. On occasion, they will parley if they think they can gain something exceptional by it. Bugbears sometimes take prisoners to use as slaves.
    Extremely greedy, bugbears love glittery, shiny objects and weapons. They are always on the lookout to increase their hoards of coins, gems, and weapons through plunder and ambush.
  Ecology: |
    Bugbears have two main goals in life: survival and treasure. They are superb carnivores, winnowing out the weak and careless adventurer, monster and animal. Goblins are always on their toes when bugbears are present, for the weak or stupid quickly end up in the stewpot.

  Description: |
    Burburs are small creatures that look much like worms. They have large, glistening black eyes and a sucking tube for a mouth, much like that of a mosquito. Just behind the creature's head are a pair of tiny forelegs of considerable dexterity. With its forelegs, a burbur can climb, grip, and manipulate objects. A burbur that has just fed will be very bloated and somewhat sluggish.
    Burburs are ivory or yellow in color and have soft, moist skin. They have a somewhat spicy body odor that has been described as smelling like cinnamon.
    Burburs are highly prized creatures that consume many varieties of slimes, mosses, and molds that might otherwise cause considerable harm to other creatures.
  Combat: |
    Burburs are gentle and harmless creatures as far as the humanoid races are concerned. They feed only on slimes, molds, or mosses; they are wholly unable to inflict damage on any other living thing.
    When it decides to feed, a burbur simply crawls out onto the body of the creature it intends to consume, extends its feeding tube and begins to siphon up its meal. Each round that it feeds, the burbur inflicts 2d4 points of damage to the slime, mold, or moss it is consuming. Once the burbur has scored a hit against the creature it is attempting to ingest, it need not roll again unless it takes a break in its feeding. A burbur ceases feeding after it has drained its victim of hit points equal to thrice its own initial value. For example, a burbur with 4 hit points will be sated after it has inflicted 12 points of damage upon its victim.
    A burbur is utterly immune to such creatures as olive or green slime, obliviax moss, and brown, yellow, or russet molds. In addition, it finds these creatures to be delicacies beyond compare.
    The burbur is also unaffected by yellow musk creepers, zygoms, and violet fungi, although it finds these creatures inedible. A burbur is affected normally by oozes, jellies, poisonous vapors, and other creatures, as well as by spell attacks.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Burburs wander constantly in search of food. Although they are normally found alone, they have been known to gather in groups of as many as four individuals to feed on a single slime, mold, or moss.
    Burburs often build small lairs that they visit from time to time to rest and recover from injuries. As a rule, these are located in out-of-the-way places and, as often as not, are protected by some creature to which the burbur is immune. For example, it is not uncommon for a burbur to seek refuge in the midst of a yellow musk creeper's coils.
    Once each year, usually in the spring, a burbur will begin to swell in size. At this point it develops a bulge at the end of its tail, which forms into a second head. As the second head forms, a pair of forelegs begins to grow out from the body. Shortly thereafter, the burbur splits in half to form two separate creatures.
  Ecology: |
    Although a small and defenseless creature like the burbur might normally be expected to fall victim to a wide variety of other predators, this is not the case. Most animals have long ago learned that eating a burbur can be a painful and, often, fatal mistake. If the burbur has recently fed, most creatures that consume it are affected as if they had come into contact with the creature the burbur recently fed upon. Thus, those animals foolish or hungry enough to devour a burbur have been weeded out by natural selection a long time ago.
    The burbur is much sought after by adventurers who find the creatures a useful ally when they do battle against slimes and similar horrors. As a rule, burburs are extremely docile and do not attack their keepers or stray unless they are underfed. In order to keep a burbur content so that it does not seek to escape its owner, it must be allowed to feed at least once per day. In the marketplace, a captured burbur can be sold for as much as 1,000 gold pieces.

  Description: |
    Buzzjewels are inoffensive insects native to wildspace . They travel through space in beautiful multi-colored swarms. They are attracted to light sources, much like moths. Sailors can always tell when a swarm of buzzjewels approaches, due to the loud droning noise from the insects' wings and the cloud of multicolored light reflected from their bodies.
    Buzzjewel bodies are partly gemstones, with opaque coloration ranging from ruby red to emerald green to aquamarine blue. When a buzzjewel dies or is killed, its organic body shrivels away, leaving a small ornamental gemstone of 5 gp value, the remnants of the mineral meals it consumed. One buzzjewel in a thousand produces a fancy, precious, or gem/jewel gemstone.
    Like other insects, buzzjewel bodies have three segments: the head, thorax, and abdomen. Buzzjewel eyes are multifaceted and quite sensitive to light. Each buzzjewel has two pairs of translucent wings similar to the dragonfly's, and three pairs of legs, which it draws close to its body during flight.
  Combat: |
    Though buzzjewels swarm around light sources, they are timid around living creatures. Not easily angered, a swarm of buzzjewels passively tolerates 1d4 rounds of attack. After this the buzzjewel swarm, finally infuriated, attacks the offender and everyone else in sight.
    All buzzjewels have tiny sharp teeth. Since buzzjewels have no taste for living flesh, they bite, then quickly let go. They attack in swarms of 10 or 20 against one opponent (10 vs. halflings , dwarves , and other small opponents). A single attack roll determines the swarm's chance to hit. The swarm overwhelms its victims; thus, the defenders get no Dexterity bonus to AC.
    Each swarm of 10 buzzjewels causes 1d8 damage. For each point of damage the swarm does, there is a 10% chance that Type N poison is injected into the wound. The poison's onset time is one round. A failed saving throw vs. poison inflicts 4d8 damage; a successful save reduces this to 2d8 damage.
    The buzzjewels' magic resistance sometimes reflects spells back at the caster. If the spell fails due to the insects' magic resistance, the spell is reflected back at the caster. If the spell fails because the buzzjewels saved against it, they don't reflect the spell.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Buzzjewels live in tiny honeycombed passages just under the surface of asteroids . They instinctively avoid worlds with humanoid populations. Buzzjewels do not require air to survive.
    As a rule, buzzjewels live on asteroids high in gemstone content. Gems are their chief source of food, though the insects can eat any mineral or rock if pressed. Interestingly, pearls are poisonous to buzzjewels. A poisoned buzzjewel turns black and does not become a valuable gem.
    Buzzjewels communicate by body movements, as bees do. When a buzzjewel swarm finds a new source of gems, it returns to its old lair and does a dance that tells the swarm where the new strike is. Dwarven sages have long tried to decipher the dance so they can obtain the gems, so far to no avail.
    Buzzjewels can be called by various insect summoning spells; if summoned, they behave as groundling insects. Note, however, if the insects are summoned to be killed for their gems, the caster loses control over them, and the enraged swarm attacks instantly.
  Ecology: |
    Buzzjewels contribute nothing to the ecosystem. In fact, races that mine gemstones strongly dislike the little gem-eaters. The gnomes call buzzjewels "gembane", and the only printable name that dwarves use is "baublebiters".
    Due to the unpredictable poisonous bite of the buzzjewels, most wise folk resist the idea of catching the bugs and killing them for their gems in a get-rich-quick scheme. The low value of the dead bodies does not make it worth the risk.
    The dohwar actually use live, caged buzzjewels as currency, much to the horror of some of other civilized races. It is rumored that the dohwar are also experimenting with buzzjewels, feeding them fancy gems to see whether, once a buzzjewel dies, it leaves behind a more valuable gem.

  Description: |
    Chattur are small mammals that exhibit traits of both primates and rodents. They are slender and quick and have very dexterous front paws that are equipped with claw-tipped fingers and an opposable thumb. Their faces are wide and their eyes seem even wider, with an innocent stare that many humans find very appealing. A band of black fur surrounds the eyes of these creatures, much like the "mask" of raccoons. It is for this reason, and not for any inherent sense of maliciousness, that chattur have been dubbed "Space Bandits".
    They can be found living on many spacefaring vessels â€“ often without the knowledge of the crew. Usually their presence is tolerated when they are discovered â€“ at least, if the discovery is made by a neutral or good-aligned crew.
    Superstitions about chatter abound. Their presence on a vessel is supposed to bring good luck. Ill treatment of a chattur will reportably rebound against the abuser at some future time. Most significantly, if chattur are seen to be leaving a vessel, that is considered a dire warning about that vessel's immediate fate.
    Chattur have their own language, which sounds much like the chirping of excited chipmunks. Many of the adults have learned to speak common from a lifetime of eavesdropping.
  Combat: |
    Not a very combative race, chattur fight only in defense of their nests, kin, or friends. The combination of their claws and bite accounts for the 1d4 points of damage. Chattur attempt to trip opponents, wrap them in nets or rope, and otherwise harass them during combat. They are ingenious at making the most of their opportunities.
    After some training, large chattur can learn to use short swords, javelins (which they use as thrusting, not thrown, weapons), or tiny crossbows (1d4 points of damage, range 3/6/9, one bolt/round). Generally, about 20% of the chattur in a given den are capable of this armed combat.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Chattur do not gather in exceptionally large communities; to find 100 together is very rare. However, their clans and warrens can be found just about everywhere. They center around a patriarch or matriarch. Sex roles are indistinguishable except for childbirth; the females share the ranks of the trained fighters with the males in more or less equal numbers.
    They are specialists at sneaking aboard ships and finding places to live where they can remain undiscovered for weeks, months, or years. They arrange very comfortable quarters, scavenging whatever items they can from around the ship.
    Though chattur can live on a crowded ship in the midst of great activity, they rarely interfere with the operation of a vessel. This is one reason their presence is tolerated so good-naturedly, though their penchant for scavenging has brought them trouble on more than one occasion.
    Chattur often fall victim to the attacks of the malicious wrybacks . While no single chattur is a match for a wryback, the chattur's social structure enables them to band together. Often, a chaotic wryback can be lured into a trap and dealt with by a group of chattur.
  Ecology: |
    Chattur can thrive in all climes. They eat a variety of foods and readily adapt to new diets and surroundings. They have the ability to breed enough chattur to comfortably occupy whatever living space they have, without overpopulating.
    When a given warren is comfortably populated, pairs of young adult chattur branch out on their own, trying to stow away aboard a spacefaring vessel or find a sheltered den on a world or asteroid.

  Description: |
    If one thinks of campaign worlds as single cells in the body of the cosmos, then one must certainly think of clockwork horrors as viruses that have come to destroy that body.
    Clockwork horrors are a form of arcane apparatus. They look something like a mechanical spider (though they have only four legs). While the body of the horror is only about two feet in diameter, the legs give the creature an overall diameter of about four feet. In the front of the body is a crystal that enables the horror to see. Two depressions, one on each side of this lens, serve the horror as hearing organs. Two limbs, located roughly below the hearing dishes, serve a number of purposes described later.
    The body of a clockwork horror is always cast as a single piece from some type of metal. The most common type of horror is created from copper, but others may be cast from silver, electrum, gold, platinum or even adamantite. The surface of the body is always highly polished and covered with pulsating runes of mystical power.
    Clockwork horrors communicate with each other by means of clicks, whirs, and similar mechanical sounds. The exact nature of their language is unknown. It is believed, however, that the horrors use a type of dot-and-dash code similar to that employed by sailors when they signal each other with lights.
  Combat: |
    All clockwork horrors share the same special defenses. They are immune to all spells that depend on biological functions for their effects. Examples of these include cure or cause wounds , feign death , polymorph other , and cloudkill . In addition all mind-affecting spells, such as charm , hypnotize , or fear , have no effect on them; nor do psionic attack modes. They can be affected only by attacks that have some power over nonliving objects. A shatter spell directed at the horror's seeing crystal will blind it for one round per level of the caster. Similarly, a dispel magic spell focused on a single horror paralyzes the horror for a like duration.
    In addition, all horrors are immune to electricity-based attacks of any type. Heat and cold affect them normally, as do all other types of spells not specifically excluded.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The wisest sages tell of an ancient humanoid race, known only as the " Lost Ones ". Records of their origin have long since faded, but frightening tales are told of their demise.
    The Lost Ones were fond of mechanisms. The more subtle and clever their devices, the better they liked them. In the end, however, their own love of such toys brought them down. One of their most brilliant artificers built a magnificent adamantite machine with workings so advanced that none but he could fathom its operation. In addition, he wove powerful spells about the contraption, bestowing on it intelligence and mystical abilities. In gratitude for its creation, the adamantite machine destroyed him.
    Over the course of the next few decades, the adamantite horror built an army of mechanical followers, each in its own image, but of lesser quality. As the horrors rose to power in their sphere , they eliminated all biological life in it. In the end, they tore apart the worlds in their sphere and used the raw materials thus obtained to build more and more horrors.
    Centuries passed for the horrors contained in the sphere of the Lost Ones. They would have been forever doomed to remain there had they not been visited by a fleet of neogi deathspiders . The neogi had come seeking slaves and "cattle" to feast upon. Instead, they found death. One by one, their ships were taken from them. In the end the neogi and their slaves found themselves forced into lifejammers ( spelljamming ships powered by life energy instead of magic).
    Now able to journey between crystal spheres, the clockwork horrors began to spread. Each crystal sphere they entered was violated and the worlds within were plundered. For those living in these doomed spheres, there was no escape.
    The society of clockwork horrors, if one can call it that, is a rigid, almost military one. Horrors have no individual identities. Rather, they have a mission: the race must survive.
    Once the clockwork horrors have established a foothold on a world, they see all living things on that world as a threat. Logically, to the horrors, such cultures must be removed â€“ and removal of living things is one thing at which the clockwork horrors are expert.
  Ecology: |
    The clockwork horrors are not natural creatures, but make radical changes in the worlds they visit. They sometimes temporarily enslave intelligent races, keeping hopes of some accommodation alive until they have total control. They also take occasional prisoners to study and analyze species weaknesses.
    A clockwork horror fleet, which nearly always consists of 10d10 captured neogi ships, leaves the worlds it visits stripped of their natural resources. Metals are strip-mined, living things are removed as useless and troublesome, and everything that can be exploited is drained away. This process takes only two or three centuries.
    The powerful weapons of the clockwork horrors are highly prized by most artificers. While they do not retain their powers after removal from the horrors, they are nonetheless interesting to study.
  Copper Horror: |
    The copper horror is the most commonly encountered horror. While all of the other horrors have a built-in weapon of some type, the copper horror is not so equipped. Copper horrors serve as the menial workers of the race. The special appendages that they use in their daily labors, however, can often be used in combat with some success. When a copper horror is forced to engage in melee, the mechanism can be used to make one attack that inflicts 1d4 points of damage. The exact nature of the attack may vary (S, P, or B), depending on the task to which the copper horror was assigned.
  Silver Horror: |
    The silver horror is somewhat less common that its copper kin, but is far more dangerous. The silver horror is the warrior of the race. It is most often encountered as a patrol or guard at work sites or in horror-dominated regions.
    The right manipulator arm of the silver horror is fashioned to serve a dual purpose. Besides enabling the silver horror to grasp and handle items in the manner of a human hand, it can present sharp blades for combat. Once extended, these spin at high speed, turning the manipulator into a deadly rotating saw that strikes for 1d6 points of damage.
    The silver horror has a missile weapon as well. Where the copper horror has a secondary manipulating arm, the silver horror has a hollow black tube. This weapon, a spring caster , is a clockwork-driven device that ejects a barbed dart at high velocity. The dart has ranges of 10/20/40 yards and inflicts 1d3 points of damage. The spring caster can fire once per round.
  Electrum Horror: |
    The electrum horror fills the role of commanding officer or overseer. It often leads patrols of silver horrors or directs the operations of large numbers of copper horrors.
    The electrum horror is equipped with the same combination manipulator/razor saw found on the silver horror. However, the electrum razor saw is sharper and more dangerous, inflicting 1d8 points of damage with a successful hit.
    Where the silver horror has a spring caster, however, the electrum horror is armed with a steam caster . The steam caster uses a jet of high pressure steam to fire its missiles. As with the spring caster, the rate of fire is but one per round. The range of the steam caster is 20/40/80 yards, and the damage inflicted by a hit is 2d4 points.
  Gold Horror: |
    The gold horror is a high-ranking member of the clockwork horror social structure. As a rule, there is only one gold horror to a planet , and its task is the direction of all horror operations on that world. Besides its keen intelligence, the gold horror's combat abilities make it more than able to carry out its mission.
    The gold horror's razor saw is one of the sharpest cutting devices known. In combat, it inflicts 1d10 points of damage. The gold horror's second arm is a black tube known as a lightning rod . Once every other combat round, the rod can unleash a stroke of lightning that functions just as the 3rd-level wizard spell, lightning bolt , but inflicting 3d6 points of damage. A saving throw vs. spell is allowed for half damage.
  Platinum Horror: |
    Seldom will more that one platinum horror be found in a given crystal sphere (campaign universe). Where gold horrors direct the actions of the lesser clockwork horrors, the platinum horror directs the gold horrors.
    The weapons of the platinum horror are the same as those of the gold horror: the razor saw and lightning rod. However, the platinum razor saw inflicts 1d12 points of damage and the lightning rod can fire every round for 4d8 points of damage. A saving throw vs. spell is allowed for half damage.
  Adamantite Horror: |
    The so-called "father" of the clockwork horror race, only one adamantite horror is known to exist. A cold and calculating entity, the adamantite horror is fond of intricate strategies and devious planning.
    When drawn into actual combat, a rare occurrence, the adamantite horror is far from helpless. Its first line of defense is its trusty razor saw. More dangerous than the saw of the platinum horror, the adamantite razor saw inflicts 1d20 damage with a successful attack.
    The adamantite horror has no lightning rod, but wields a weapon known as the nightmare stick . Each round, the nightmare stick functions as the 6th-level wizard spell, disintegrate , with a 50-yard range. A saving throw vs. spell is allowed to avoid the deadly effect.

  Description: |
    The "civilized" grell is a colonial (as the term is used for ants and other colony animals) version of the underground ravager of Oerth . It is similar in size and appearance to terrestrial grells. Unlike its solitary kin, however, it can speak via telepathic link with both grell philosophers and the highly intelligent grell patriarch.
    The grell's arrogance surpasses all other intelligent beings. Spacegoing grells acknowledge no equals, regarding even terrestrial grells as lesser beings. "Lesser being", in the grell language, means the same thing as "food".
  Combat: |
    Grell battle tactics resemble those of their lesser kin; they use levitation ability to hide in the upper reaches of large chambers. However, their ability to function in groups lets them mount vicious assaults, wielding tip-spears and lightning lances . Tip-spears are edged metallic heads that fit by suction over the tips of a soldier-grell's tentacles. The grell can make slashing attacks doing 1-6 points of damage, or stab doing double damage.
    Victims impaled on tip-spears are considered paralyzed, and subject to the same fate as those who are grappled, i.e., automatically hit by subsequent tentacles, etc. (See Grell, Wild for full information on grappling.) Anyone captured faces imprisonment and later consumption as part of the grell raiders' food supply.
    The grell lightning lances deliver 3d6 electrical damage (save vs. spell for half damage). Each lance has 36 charges and can fire once per round.
    I wildspace , grell ships do not spelljam so much as submerge and surface in space, traveling "underneath" space using some bizarre dimensional passage that the grill patriarch generates. When out in the flow , the front end of the ship opens, exposing a hollow tube that runs the length of the vessel. The grell ship then ignites the inrushing phlogiston, ejecting the exhaust gases from the rear in a motion similar to that of a squid. The spelljamming patriarch controls the size of the phlogiston burn.
    In a hopeless situations the grell patriarch can transform the ship into a vaguely humanoid form via telekinesis. The giant armored fighter strikes with an oversized halberd for 1d10 hull points of damage. The halberd can loose an electric arc tor 3d6 hull points, but takes one round to recharge. The giant's fists can strike for 1d3 hull points each.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Grell have a distinct pyramidal hierarchy. The patriarch stands at the top, and a secondary caste, the philosophers, handles the lower castes. Each grell "family" occupies a ship.
    The Patriarch: Each grell ship has a solitary patriarch who handles the workings and navigation of the ship. He is a sessile mass of flesh approximately 30' in diameter whose tentacles have grafted themselves to the floor of his chamber. The patriarch's enormous brain controls the higher functions of all the shipboard family. All other castes serve the patriarch.
    Philosophers: These grell serve as intermediaries between the patriarch and the workers. They have limited authority to lead the worker/soldier grell in organized combat. A grell philosopher may (20% chance) wear a ring of protection (AC 0). Some philosophers can use magic as 2nd-level wizards. There is one philosopher for every 10 worker/soldier grell.
    Workers/soldiers: This common garden-variety grell, limited in intelligence, performs minor maintenance aboard ship. They make up most of a grell family or raiding party.
    Imperator: Above all families stands the Imperator, who holds absolute sway over all grell families and can unite them as a single fighting force. Known as the Legion of Gold , due to the uniform golden color of their spaceships, this horde sweeps over space like locusts, leaving nothing but debris in its wake.
  Ecology: |
    Grell are the true wastrels of wildspace races. Arrogant and vicious, they hunt an area to exhaustion, then move on to more fertile regions. Their (re)discovery of huma space means only a rich storehouse of meat to these monsters.

    Size: G (60' tall)
    Morale: Unsteady (6)
    XP Value: 27,000
  Description: |
    These dim-witted giants are 60 feet tall and weigh 70 tons. Although not related to the giants of the known worlds, they are basically humanoid.
    Compared to huma proportions, their heads are too small and their legs are too short. Their features tend to be thick and bulbous. Their foreheads slope back sharply and their noses are round blobs of flesh. Their teeth are rarely straight and always have jagged edges. Their fingers are stubby and thick, completely unsuited for delicate manipulations. A colossus can have any color eyes and hair, but black is the most common. Their voices are like rolling thunder, understandable but slow and deep.
    Colossi wear heavy, coarse clothes â€“ usually a tunic, breeches, and sandals. Crude though it is, the tailoring is much too fine for any colossus to have stitched it. The clothes can be almost any color, with no regard to fashion sense. It is not uncommon to find large patches covering rips and tears. Colossi never carry weapons or armor, though they could if they wanted to.
  Combat: |
    Compared to a human, a colossus moves slowly and ponderously. As a result, its great movement rate is only a third of what its 30-foot stride would normally indicate.
    Its THAC0 is much worse than one would expect because of its slow movement. In fact, it can attack only once every other round with either a fist punch or a foot stomp. In addition, creatures under 25 feet tall get a -2 Armor Class bonus and those under 10 feet tall get a -4 Armor Class bonus.
    But when a colossus manages to hit, the victim must roll a saving throw. vs. death magic (failure means death), in addition to the damage done (see pg. 75 in the DMG ). Any blow can cause structural damage. Smashing and blunt weapons have no effect whatsoever.
    A colossus can clap its hands together with great force and cause a stunning vibration. This is akin to being right next to an explosion. The clap has a range of 60 feet and causes anyone within that range to roll a saving throw vs. paralyzation; failure means the victim is stunned for 1d3 rounds. All characters in the radius of effect are automatically deaf for 1d6 turns.
    A colossus can throw boulders up to 500 yards for 5d10 points of damage, but its aim is so poor that it rarely hits what it aims at. In wildspace , a colossus is big enough to be its own ship. Indeed, it has the same air volume as a 15-ton ship. It consumes as much air as a full crew of 10. The colossus can coast through space for months without running out of air.
    Food and water can be a problem, though. A colossus cannot propel itself through wildspace except by making a leap from a solid surface, which means it is very slow moving under its own power. It would be possible to fix a spelljamming helm to it and make it into a spelljamming speed "ship" of maneuverability class E. Its plane of gravity makes its back or stomach the walking surface.
  Habitat/Society: |
    In wildspace these simple creatures are encountered singly. They are usually lost wanderers. They talk about a home called Arhoad , assumed to be a planet . This mythical place has never be found, and the colossi are never able to describe how to find it or how they became lost. It is one of the great mysteries of wildspace.
    They speak of close families on Arhoad, so it is assumed that they have a clan society. Since they could not possibly have made their own clothing, many scholars assume that they are the worker or slave class of yet another race, although there is no evidence to support this theory. The reigar accept responsibility for the colossi's plight.
    The good colossi are quite friendly and helpful to travelers. The evil ones are marauders and killers, destroying property for the sheer joy of it. Neither variety is considered to be very smart. The only long-term goal they have is to find Arhoad. However, they never seem to know how to go about doing it.
  Ecology: |
    No one has ever seen a sick colossus or seen one die from anything other than injuries. While they are known to have two sexes, children have never been seen. They do not seem to age, at least not in the few hundred years they have been in known space. They can eat virtually any type of plant. The evil ones eat meat, but they do not seem to need it in their diets. It is assumed that they do it only for the terrorizing effect.

    Size: G (1 to 100 million square miles)
    Morale: Fearless (19-20)
    XP Value: N/A
  Description: |
    The peaceful constellates are made of small motes of light gathered in constellations, groupings of stars that suggest various objects and life forms. Surrounding each constellation is the ghostly image of the thing it represents â€“ the constellate proper. These ghostly images depict wolves, swords, warriors, and the like.
    Individual stars' colors vary, but most are bluish-white. Their color may relate to their age. No single star has ever separated from its constellate group.
  Combat: |
    Constellates choose to avoid battle when possible. Generally they fly away from danger (playing hob with astronomers in the process!). After the danger has passed, the constellate returns to its position.
    When an Aperusa clan leader summons a constellate, its nature changes radically. Witnesses see an immense shadowy figure shaped like the constellation drop down from the heavens. The stars diffuse and move randomly within the constellate's body. It can change size at will, usually to maintain its size relative to the viewers; for instance, the Panther constellate seems to remain panther-sized whether in the sky or on a ship's deck. The constellate gains the special abilities of the character or object it portrays: e.g. the Swan could use wing buffets, and the Krynnspace constellation Raistlin-Fistandantilus could use timestop.
    If it wishes, the constellate can melee at up to its full size â€“ often millions of square miles! The full-size constellate can crush with its enormous bulk, causing 2d20 points of damage per 1,000 square miles of area. The range of this attack is the constellate's size. It can use this attack form once every other round. It can also throw bolts of energy (called sunbolts ) with unerring accuracy. Sunbolts cause 2d12 points of damage for every 1,000 square miles of the constellate's area. The range of the sunbolts is believed to be 500,000 miles. Damage does not decrease over distance; however, accuracy does decrease. At short range (125,000 miles) there is no penalty to the attack roll; medium range (125,001-250,000 miles) takes a -2 penalty; and long range (250,001-500,000 miles) takes a -5 penalty. The constellate can use this attack once per round, even while it uses its crushing blow.
    The sunbolt is a cone-shaped area 1,000 miles in diameter. When this area of effect is added to the strength of the sunbolt , the constellate can literally crush planets at its whim. Some believe that the Grinder asteroid belt within the heavens of Greyspace is actually the residue of a summoned constellate's attack. Legends speak of constellates who inflicted great harm against a planet within that crystal sphere . The gods retaliated against these constellates, thereby banning them from the crystal sphere. The constellates' whereabouts are unknown.
    A constellate's attack lasts only five rounds. There are no reports of an attack lasting longer that this. It then resumes its place in the sky and its former nature. A given constellate can only be summoned once a year.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Each constellation in a sphere's night sky is a constellate. They occupy their assigned positions, swapping choice information about the goings-on of the groundling races or lamenting their eternal celestial imprisonment. The advent of spelljamming ships has created new gossip for these beings, and their overall morale has risen.
    Although they converse freely among themselves through telepathy, they never speak to corporeal life forms. Attempts to imprison and interrogate constellates fail, for they simply change size to escape from their prison.
  Ecology: |
    Sages dispute the true genesis of the constellates. Some postulate that they have existed as long as the stars in the sky. Others point to Krynnspace, where new constellations appeared and old ones disappeared in the War of the Lance. Still others talk of the influence of divine entities.
    Why the Aperusa have an affinity with the constellates is an equally tantalizing mystery. They have never divulged their spells of summoning, and with the constellate as allies, it is unlikely that anyone will wrest the secret from the wildspace gypsies.

  Description: |
    Contemplators live on barren asteroids , pondering the questions of the universe. Some say that when one discovers all the answers to all the questions, the universe will end.
    A contemplator is found most often seated in the classical thinker pose on a large stone outcropping. A gray humanoid, 12' tall, he often wears a gray toga. Consequently, unwary adventurers may easily mistake him for a statue.
  Combat: |
    A contemplator yearns for all knowledge and has deduced that the best way to gather it is directly from the minds of other beings. To gather information, he captures any intelligent being who lands on or comes near his asteroid.
    The contemplator creates three arms out of the asteroid's surface to capture his specimens. Each arm can extend 50' and has 25 hit points. If an arm is destroyed, the contemplator can create another after 24 hours have passed.
    If forced into a fight personally, the contemplator punches with his own two arms (inflicting 2d8 points of damage with each) as well as with his three extra appendages.
    When a contemplator captures a victim with one of the three large arms, he encases its body in a thin (1/4" thick) layer of stone and drains its Intelligence, one point a day. This requires the contemplator's uninterrupted concentration. If he is disturbed at any time, that day's point of Intelligence remains with the captured character (at least for one more day). Each day, the entombed victim can attempt a Bend Bars/Lift Gates roll to escape the stone prison. When the victim's Intelligence is reduced to 3, the contemplator's stone arm flings the now-useless simpleton into space.
    If a wish or similar magic restores a character's Intelligence, the knowledge restored vanishes from the contemplator who stole it. If this restored character ever comes within 50 miles of the contemplator who lost the knowledge, the contemplator immediately detects, intercepts, and attacks the character. A contemplator cannot tolerate knowing something and then having it taken away!
    A contemplator who drains a wizard gains all the wizard's memorized spells. He casts these acquired spells only once, for he won't waste the time necessary to write them down. He can only use wizard spells, not those of priests. A contemplator still must use material components for spells that require them.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The contemplator spends all of his time on his asteroid sifting through his acquired knowledge, searching for any clue to the origin and end of the universe. He is totally devoid of emotion, but he is usually willing to negotiate for a captive's life. The price is often a quest for information, such as the answer to a question. The contemplator always sets a time limit on the quest and, once the deal is made, never reneges or renegotiates.
    A contemplator can move his asteroid through space using a mysterious form of locomotion. He is usually content to drift through space, but when the need arises, he can move quickly in any direction.
    A contemplator knows of any change on the surface of his asteroid, as though it were an extension of his body. This makes stealthy approach impossible except by flight.
  Ecology: |
    Strewn about the contemplator's asteroid are the material remains of his past conflicts. When he tosses his victims into wildspace, the contemplator keeps their possessions, primarily for his experiments with newfound spells. He still needs the components to make them work correctly.

  Description: |
    From the Ruined Kingdoms of Nog and Kadar came rumors, and finally proof, of this special form of undead created to serve their masters for an eternity. Since the method for creating them was uncovered, crypt servants have been created for more modern tombs as well.
    Crypt servants appear as corpses, usually desiccated, and usually huma , though elves , dwarves , and other races are not unknown. They are usually dressed in the livery of their master, the person buried in the tomb they serve. Many, especially those more recently created, bear mamluk tattoos.
    Crypt servants speak the language of their master in dry, slithery voices.
  Combat: |
    Though created to serve their master in all ways after death, crypt servants are usually encountered while defending their master's tomb and possessions from desecration. A solitary crypt servant or the crypt servant nearest the tomb's entrance acts as a guard. Intruders are challenged verbally by the guard; most require a certain verbal command or a visible sign of the family of their master. Intruders who do not respond properly are attacked.
    Intruders who make it past a guardian crypt servant will not be challenged by other crypt servants unless they disturb the master's possessions. Anyone who disturbs the body of the master is attacked regardless of any commands or signs they offer to deter the crypt servants.
    Crypt servants who engage in combat call to other crypt servants in the tomb. Despite the quiet nature of the creature's voice, all the crypt servants in a tomb respond in 1d6 rounds. Many crypt servants are provided with weapons of some sort; they attack with their fists if they are not. They attack in a mindless fury, concentrating on the last person to cause a disturbance to their master or their master's possessions.
    Like other undead, crypt servants are immune to charm , hold , and sleep spells.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Though it is possible to create a crypt servant from any dead body, volunteers are usually preferred; many ancient crypt servants actually volunteered for their posts, wishing to serve their masters in death as in life. Mamluks sometimes volunteer in modern times.
    Crypt servants care for their deceased master and all the rooms and possessions in the tomb. Small tombs have only one crypt servant, while grand tombs of wealthy and powerful individuals may have several. Crypt servants clean and repair the tombs, polish valuables, light candles, and guard the tomb from intruders. At first, they are fervent in their need to serve, but as years â€“ and centuries â€“ pass, they take longer breaks between activity, sometimes standing motionless for days or even years before becoming active again.
    Because of their similar purpose and method of creation, crypt servants are sometimes associated with the crypt thing. The spells to create each are similar and probably have the same roots. If the crypt thing is available for the DM's campaign, one may be found as the leader of a group of crypt servants.
  Ecology: |
    A crypt servant has no proper ecological niche. It neither adds to nor detracts from its environment, except to occasionally eliminate intruders and other vermin.

  Description: |
    See " Plasmoid, General Information " for base information on this race.
    DeGleash are large, wet blobs that favor a form resembling a bowling pin (a fat base with a narrowing upper body). They are white to cream colored and constantly sway and bob about. They prefer to use no legs, propelling themselves forward by having their bases flow over the surface. They can do this at a rate of 9. They also prefer to form only enough arms for the task at hand (thus they have no arms when not trying to manipulate something). These arms tend to be short and stalk-like. They employ two ganglia masses for eyes, which they usually place high on their bodies. Their auditory nerves are usually scattered about their body. Waste constantly excretes via osmosis through their thin outer membrane. They rarely form a mouth orifice.
    DeGleash can produce four arms of 18/01-18/50 strength. If all of their fibers are put into one slow muscle (not for attack) they can lift as much as 10,000 lbs. for short durations (1d4 rounds).
    They can form appendages as fine as a 1/16 inch in diameter. They can absorb or produce limbs as fast as a huma can move his arm. DeGleash have such incredible control over their bodies that a net cast over a deGleash would slowly pass through its body if it desired (it just disconnects nerves and fibers where the netâ€™s strands are passing, then reconnects them afterward).
    The least malleable part of a deGleash is its brain, but even that can be quickly squashed into a five-inch diameter tube that is one foot long. If a deGleash spends several hours, it can slowly string its brain out to fit through a hole only one inch in diameter (the smallest hole a deGleash can pass through).
    A man-sized deGleash can stretch thin enough to reach something 50 feet in the air (large-sized ones can reach 75 feet, huge ones can stretch 100 feet). To stretch this thin requires one round. Likewise a deGleash could move through a one-foot-diameter hole in a round. Smaller holes take a lot more time, up to several hours to fit through a one-inch hole.
    DeGleash can secrete a calcium-based substance that quickly hardens and forms a shell around them. This is too fragile to add to their AC, but it is useful to keep them from flowing all over while they sleep. When they wake, they reabsorb the shell.
    They can carry up to 1,200 lbs. of items within their bodies if the items' overall volume is a cubic yard or less. DeGleash themselves weigh 2,000, 4,000, and 8,000 lbs. (for size M, L, and H, respectively). They are incapable of jumping, but they can climb wails with 90% success.
  Combat: |
    DeGleash can use 1d4 arms in combat with no penalties. Additional arms inflict a -2 attack roll penalty for all arms. They prefer to attack with two pseudopod fists and wield two shields (AC 0). They can strike an opponent up to 8' away with full strength (greater distances reduce the damage by 2 points per foot).
    DeGleash get very excited before and during combat. It is a habit of this species to begin booming at this time. Opponents who hear this terrible sound must roll successful saving throws vs. petrification or be struck with dread (penalties of +2 and -2 on combat rolls). If a deGleash concentrates for one round, it can release a tremendous boom that requires all within 20 feet to make saving throws vs. paralyzation or become deaf for 1d20 rounds (+2 penalty to AC). Finally, deGleash can envelop enemies who are at least one size smaller than they. This requires a THAC0 roll, adjusted only by the victim's Dexterity. Once enveloped, a victim suffers 1d8 points of digestive damage per round. Furthermore, if the deGleash concentrates, it can bring its muscle fibers to bear upon the hapless foe, holding him with an effective Strength of 20, causing 8 additional points of damage a round. If the victim is not held, a successful bend bars roll enables him to move; if held, three consecutive successful bend bars rolls must be made. Of course, suffocation is a problem for those enveloped as well.
    DeGleash suffer no damage from piercing weapons, Â½ damage from slashing weapons, and full damage from bludgeoning weapons. Fire causes double damage. Cold-based attacks slow them by 1 per 10 dice of damage.
    As with all plasmoids, deGleash are immune to disease and poison of all types. Only acid damage in excess of 30 points per round can harm them.
    A deGleash's AC is due to its ability to shape its body away from an attacking blow. It can even open into a ring.

  Description: |
    See " Plasmoid, General Information " for base information on this race.
    DelNorics prefer a short, stocky bi- or multipedal form. Their arms and legs are usually identical. They prefer mitten-like hands, round, stump-like feet, and a neckless head. They have two auditory and two visual ganglia, which they place upon their heads in the locations common to most bipeds. They also form a mouth orifice and even occasionally produce slight nose-like appendages (even though they can't smell).
    What distinguishes delNorics from the other plasmoids is their covering. They can form a half-inch-thick, stiff leathery hide. This hide is simply a mesh of their body fibers that they allow to dry out. As it grows thicker, it often cracks where the delNoric bends. DelNorics usually look like they have wide strips of leather hanging off their bodies. This coating is grey to brown in coloration.
    DelNorics have a lot less plasma than most plasmoids. For this reason, it takes them much longer to transform. A typical appendage requires a full turn of concentration. They cannot flow with their covering in place and thus they form legs for locomotion. With their covering, delNorics cannot form an appendage smaller than five inches in diameter. Without the covering, a one-inch-diameter appendage can be formed. If they must form fingers, they tear holes in their covering and extend unprotected appendages. A delNoric's brain cannot be squashed any smaller than a five-inch-diameter area.
    DelNorics can support 12,000 lbs. for several hours when contained within their covering.
    They commonly have several lip-like areas on their bodies. These open into leather coated pouches in which they keep their possessions. DelNorics are capable of carrying 1,000 lbs. of items. However, since these must be very dense in order to be of small enough volume, this amount is rarely carried.
    Small-sized delNorics can stretch their bodies upward to a height of ten feet (15 feet if man-sized, 20 feet if large).
    A delNoric's covering protects it from drying out, thus it can adventure even in desert climates. It also enables it to sleep while only marginally losing its form.
  Combat: |
    DelNorics can employ 1d3 appendages for attack and defense with no penalty. Each additional appendage inflicts the -2 cumulative attack roll penalty common to all plasmoids.
    If they concentrate (no actions for a round), delNorics can "inhale" a large volume of air and then force it out of a small hole (often their pseudo-mouth) for the next 1d4 rounds. This causes a loud squealing sound that requires a saving throw vs. paralyzation or it inflicts 1d4 points of damage to all who can hear it within 20 feet (even other delNoric).
    Furthermore, delNorics keep their supply of entire digestive acid in one internal container. They usually form a tube that exits their body in some convenient area for expelling this acid onto an opponent. This requires their full concentration. The expelled acid can be shot in a stream up to 20 feet to strike one opponent, or it can be sprayed in a mist upon all those within a cone ten feet long and five feet in diameter (at the far end). The stream causes 2d10 points of damage, while the cone causes 3d4 points of damage to each victim. The stream requires a normal attack roll for the delNoric, while the cone's victims roll saving throws vs. breath weapon for half damage. This acid spewing attack can be used only once every hour.
    DelNorics are slow to react; their AC is due mainly to their tough, thick hide. Without this covering their AC is 8.
    DelNorics suffer half damage from piercing and slashing weapons, but full damage from bludgeoning weapons. Furthermore, their thick hide allows fire-based attacks to cause only half their normal damage (though double damage without the hide). Every 20 points of cold damage slows them by 1 (every 10 points if no hide). Acid in any quantity inflicts no damage.
  Habitat/Society: |
    DelNorics have a particular enmity toward deGleash , whom they call "The Soft Ones". They have taken a liking to dwarves as well as to the dwarven lust for gold.
  Ecology: |
    DelNorics eat anything, though for some unknown reason (not due to taste or smell), they have taken a particular liking to meat. DelNoric hides are sought after to make leather shields and breast plates. Such armor has half the weight of metal armor, but the same durability.

    Size: L (9' long)
    Morale: Average (9)
    XP Value: 120
  Description: |
    These friendly beasts swim harmlessly through the phlogisto . They have on occasion been known to help stranded travelers. A delphinid has a fish-shaped body with trilateral symmetry, with everything found in triplicate. The head tapers to a blunt nose. There are three eyes placed equidistantly around the head. The mouth has three jaws, all of which are hinged. There are three large dorsal fins equidistantly around the large, central part of the body. The tail has three fins as well.
    Delphinids can change color to match the swirling phlogiston. They can make multi-colored swirls and streamers across their hide. A dead delphinid is a pale grey color. They have been known to intentionally turn grey, black, or white in order to be seen by passing sailors.
  Combat: |
    A delphinid can attack only by ramming (its teeth are too small to be used effectively as weapons). A delphinid can ram every other round. Each ram inflicts 1d6 points of damage. Any creature that weighs less than the delphinid must roll a successful Dexterity check or be knocked down (or off, or over, or whatever).
    Delphinids rarely initiate combat. They attack only to protect themselves or their friends. They are smart enough to be creative in their strategies and tactics. They can be taught tricks or maneuvers quite easily.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Delphinids are found only in the phlogiston currents. They are usually found swimming with the current, not against it. Since they cannot travel at spelljamming speeds, they are encountered only by ships that are at rest or traveling at tactical speeds.
    Delphinids are quite friendly. They will play and cavort with sailors. They are dexterous enough that they can dive into a ship's gravity, keep control of their trajectory, and make it back out. Any aggressive behavior or attempt to hurt or dominate a delphinid causes the entire school to vanish into the flow.
    If a sailor falls off a deck, delphinids have been known to carry him back to the ship. If they are feeling particularly frisky, they may even give a sailor a joy ride. The sight of a school of delphinids can do wonders for the morale of a crew that has been in space too long.
    Each delphinid has its own personality. While they travel together in a school, there does not appear to be a leader. Each delphinid does as it pleases. The group tends to follow the one with the idea of the moment. They like elves , humans , gnomes , halflings , kender, and other fun-loving races. They avoid beholders , mind flayers , neogi , lizard me , and other aggressive races. They are neutral toward dwarves , the arcane , giff , dracons , and such.
  Ecology: |
    Delphinids somehow get their nourishment from phlogiston. They like various treats that sailors are fond of throwing to them. In particular they like fruit of any sort. Unfortunately for them, fruit is a rare commodity aboard a spelljamming ship.
    Delphinid young are born live, with a single calf per birth. Both parents raise the calf until it is old enough to defend itself. Once the calf has left its parents, they part ways as well. Delphinids do not mate for life.
    Delphinid flesh is sweet and tender. The neogi consider it a delicacy. Most good or neutrally aligned human sailors consider it bad luck to kill a delphinid.

  Description: |
    Dizantar are tall, armored humanoids that spend most of their time hunting down and killing arcane.
    These creatures are always encountered in silvery, heavy plate mail of special construction with smooth, tightly fitting joints. The rest of the armor is covered with spikes and razor-sharp edges. No part of the body is left visible. Even the eye slits show only black, like the depths of wildspace . Despite the weight of this armor, dizantar move quickly, silently, and with great agility. Their voices are soft and whispery. They speak common, but most have their own language as well.
    There is no recorded account of what a dizantar's body looks like. When the armor is opened, all that is found is smoking black ashes. Their extreme height and three fingered gauntlets lead most sages to the conclusion that they are not huma.
  Combat: |
    The only weapon dizantar have ever been seen with is a ten-foot-long halberd with an unusually ornate head and a metal shaft. They wield it with a Strength of 18/00, giving them a +3 bonus to the attack roll and +6 damage bonus. This weapon can harm creatures that can be hit only by +1 magical weapons or better. Both the halberd and the armor glow when subjected to a detect magic spell.
    If need be, a dizantar can use the spikes and edges on its armor to cause damage. Any punch inflicts 1d6 points of plumage from the spikes and edges. Anyone attempting to wrestle or grapple with a dizantar suffers 1d6 points of damage. Ropes and other bindings cast about a dizantar are severed in a single round. The armor also provides a 20% resistance to all forms of magic.
    A dizantar can use the halberd to cast a glowing, magical line. The motion is similar to that of a fly-casting fisherman. If the attack roll is successful, the line is magically fixed to the victim. Only a wish spell can remove it. No damage is caused by the line, but the dizantar can follow the line to the victim anywhere within a crystal sphere . The line is severed by passing through the sphere wall or by any form of planar travel.
    A dizantar can use only those miscellaneous magical items not specific to a player character class. It can do so only if the item is specifically needed for its quest. The item is discarded carelessly as soon as it is no longer useful. A dizantar can use a dimension door spell up to three times a day, but only in wildspace. It can detect invisible and see through illusions at all times.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Dizantar can be found anywhere in space or on any planet . The location and nature of their native crystal sphere is a mystery. They are at home in space for short periods of time, apparently protected by their armor. A dizantar will frequently commandeer a spelljamming ship to search out its victim. They do not build their own ships.
    Dizantar are always found alone. They deal with weaker beings only if this serves their purposes. More often they take what they need, unaffected by the resulting death or destruction. They may work with more powerful creatures toward a common goal, but they prefer not to. Dizantar are cold, calculating, fearless, and not bothered by morals or ethics. Only two things motivate dizantar â€“ revenge and hunting arcane. Dizantar kill arcane on sight. They spend most of their time hunting down members of this race and killing them. Fortunately, dizantar are far less numerous than the masters of the spelljamming helms . Occasionally dizantar are encountered on missions of vengeance against other creatures.
  Ecology: |
    If dizantar eat, they always make sure to do it out of sight of "lesser" creatures. The arcane fear them greatly. Strangely, the arcane refuse to talk much about dizantar. Any rumor of a dizantar in the area is cause for an arcane to vanish or immediately hire a squad of bodyguards.

    9 HD President: 1,400
  Description: |
    The dohwar are short, pudgy, flightless avians bearing a passing resemblance to penguins. They are shameless merchants, always looking for an opportunity to turn a profit. Since the arcane (otherwise known as "Our Competitors") are considered the greatest merchants of wildspace , the dohwar try harder to displace them.
    The average dohwar stands 4' tall. Black feathers cover most of its body, except for its chest, covered in white feathers. The dohwar has two wings that are useless for flight but have limited prehensile action, allowing it to grasp objects. Dohwar do not walk, they waddle. Their mode of dress is a garish mishmash of clashing clothes that would make an Aperusa blush. Amazingly, the dohwar have figured out that groundling civilizations may be disconcerted by their avian appearance. On these planets , the dohwar wear heavy hoods and cloaks and try to pass for short people.
    Though the dohwar speak Common and their own tongue, they rely heavily on telepathic powers for communication among themselves. In fact, dohwar have pairings called "mergers", wherein two dohwar stay in mental rapport, even to the point of finishing each other's sentences. This drives other races crazy.
  Combat: |
    As a race, the dohwar are not fighters. They rely on others to do their fighting for them. Their philosophy towards combat is to tell their hired muscle, "Here's 500 more gold pieces. Keep attacking". Dohwar often hire giff mercenaries.
    The dohwar, with amazing foresight and awareness of harsh reality, know they cannot always depend on handy mercenaries. Thus they have Protectors, dohwars that are actually trained to fight. Protectors wield the "weega", a sword blade that fits over the dohwar's beak. This turns an otherwise ineffectual peck into a powerful sword thrust doing 1d6 damage to small and man-sized targets and 1d8 to larger victims.
    Some protectors ride space swine , the winged pigs of the dohwar. The dohwar have even organized an elite air cavalry called the Deathsquealers. This cavalry is organized into squads of four Deathsquealer riders each. Besides the weega, riders carry light lances. Deathsquealers have the non-weapon proficiencies of land-based Riding, aerial Riding, Blindfighting, and Tumbling.
    Only Protectors wear armor. They prefer bulky plate armor but carry no shields. The only drawback of the armor is its clumsiness; armored dohwar attack last in a combat round. Against all logic, even Deathsquealers wear this heavy, unwieldy armor. Fortunately, no similar suit exists for the space swine.
    All dohwar have fangs, which they developed over the centuries to eat tough, exotic plants found on the many worlds of wildspace. These fangs, a last desperate defensive measure, do 1d2 damage.
    The fangs are the only weapon that all non-protector dohwar have. Non-protector dohwar do not carry weapons nor wear armor.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Manager dohwar have either wizard or priest spells (50% chance each) and have reached 6th level. Managers cannot be specialist mages. Managers act as the spelljammers on merchant ships.
    Executive Board members and Presidents have a similar spell arrangement. Use the dohwar's Hit Dice to determine its spellcasting level (e.g., a President casts spells as a 9th-level spellcaster). Spellcasters choose few combat spells and prefer defensive, divinatory, negotiation-enhancing, concealing, and especially healing spells. Dohwar hate pain.
    There is one Merchant for every four dohwar encountered, one Manager for every 20, and one Executive Board member for every 40. For every five conventional dohwar encountered, there is one Protector. Rarely (5%) groups are composed entirely of Protectors. If more than eight Protectors are encountered, they are all Deathsquealers.
    A "cartel" consists of 10d10+80 dohwar, plus 10d4Ã—10 children. A cartel is run by a President, who is the final arbiter of all matters.
    Life-style: Though the dohwar can live anywhere, they prefer arctic or sub-arctic climes near large bodies of water. They are monogamous and mate for life in a union called a "merger". The female lays 1d4 eggs ("new wares") annually. These mergers are telepathic; mates are in constant mental communication to an effective range of 10 miles. If one partner is slain, the other goes berserk, trying to kill everything in its path. The mental link takes one turn to forge and one round to break.
    The dohwar's other mental power is ESP usable at will. A dohwar must rest one turn for every round that the power is used. Thus, if a dohwar activates its ESP for five turns of negotiations, it must spend five hours resting, using no mental ability. A dohwar can use mental powers for a maximum of two hours.
    Dohwar eat fish, vegetables, and plankton. They are fond of strong drink, and alcohol does not intoxicate them. Sweets, on the other hand, are highly intoxicating; to a dohwar, one apple has the effect of strong beer, and a few tablespoons of honey or maple syrup get it blind drunk.
    The dohwar worship powers associated with commerce, profits and wealth. The power's race or alignment is unimportant. Dohwar variously venerate Abbathor, the dwarve god of greed; the Realms ' Waukeen, goddess of commerce; Krynn 's Shinare, goddess of commerce; and Zilchus, Greyhawk 's god of business and money. Though they love money, the dohwar are generous with religious contributions. Some speculate that they see such tithes as "cosmic investments", with the powers in return giving the dohwar a divine advantage in bargaining sessions.
    Personality: Though the dohwar are chaotic neutral, this best describes their behavior to other races. Among themselves, they are surprisingly well organized and helpful. They feel (incorrectly) that the multiverse is out to get them, that everyone wants to see them go broke. Thus, despite their lust for wealth, they stick together and try not to sell each other short â€“ at least not often.
    The dohwar know few social skills, nor have they any interest in learning. They are obnoxious, brash, persistent, money grubbing merchants. Their standard way to do business is by pairing up against prospective customers and talking them into submission. Clients face a pair of fanged penguins who talk non-stop and finish each other's sentences. The merger recites a fast, lengthy list of goods for sale, interspersed with offers to purchase various objects on the client's person.
    Dohwar wares are many and varied. Anything from the Player's Handbook may show up in a dohwar ship's hold, even things like wagons and small boats, as well as magical items, magical weapons, spell components, books, scrolls and potions. Gnomish inventions also clutter many a dohwar ship. There is an 80% chance to find any specific non-magical product on a dohwar ship. For magical items, consult the Treasure Type stats.
  Ecology: |
    The dohwar do not contribute to nor disrupt the ecological balance of wildspace.
    There is a dohwar homeworld in the far reaches of wildspace, an arctic planet teeming with millions of dohwar, all wheeling and dealing. Thus far, no one has shown an interest in visiting or even learning its location.

  Description: |
    The dracons are a sentient race of dragon-centaurs that have recently appeared on the fringe of the Known Spheres . Dracon exploration ships have been spotted in the phlogisto and at the edges of known space . They are just beginning to appear at the smaller communities of space.
    A dracon is centaurlike in appearance, with the body of a brontosaur, the torso and arms of a huma , and the head of a drago . Its feet are flat, like those of an elephant, and it has a long, snakelike tail. Its hands have six digits (five fingers and a thumb) and end in claws.
    Dracons speak their own language and that of dragons. They speak the common tongue haltingly and with a thick accent. Their speech is often formal and ornately ceremonial.
  Combat: |
    Dracons found in space will be found on ships with spelljamming helms . These are usually modified galleons , but there have been cases of hammerships appearing among the dracons.
    The dracons consider themselves civilized, and have among themselves a stylized dueling code. Under this code, one challenges another, the challenged getting choice of weapons (swords, bare hands, etc.). The challenger then names the terms of the battle (to the death, to first blood, to half hit points, or to three falls, for example). Finally, the challenged names the place and time (within reason, though a dracon rhyme speaks of the Battle Eternal, in which heroes return each year to fight a single round of combat).
    The dracons use these codes among themselves, but do not offer them to non-dracons. Should an individual outside the race offer such terms, the dracon would be honor-bound to adhere to them, within reason. (A single dracon will not accept a challenge from a mind flayer , unless said mind flayer pledges not to use its psionic blast.)
    Dracons usually use thin-bladed long swords in combat, but are just as adept at holds and wrestling. Their long thumb-claws make them particularly dangerous; they use these to inflict 1-4 points of damage in hand-to-hand combat. In addition to their swords, dragons carry large darts (1-6 points of damage. thrown 1/round, range of 20/40/60 yards) and halberds. The last is useful in space as a grappling hook, but is not used in most common combat. It is most often used in formal duels and as a ceremonial tool.
    Dracons are adequate metalsmiths, the equal of elves but less skilled tha dwarves . They carry armor on board, to be ritualistically donned before entering battle. This improves their Armor Class to AC 3, if they have sufficient time to prepare.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The vegetarian dracons follow a strong herd instinct among their people, which carries through into space. A lone dracon is a rarity and a freak among its people, and the dracons prefer to travel in familial units, headed by the eldest dracon, male or female. Dracons separated from their family will take ill unless they find a method of recreating a familial unit, and individuals have been known to adopt non-dracons as psuedofamily members.
    Sages assume that the most adventurous of the dracon species have traveled in the newest ships to new planets , but even so the dracons seem stuffy and passive, more content to retreat than fight. There are exceptions, in particular those dracons who have adopted humanoids into their family units.
    The leader of a dracon herd is called a kaba. The choosing of a kaba is determined not by the strongest, nor the swiftest, but by means of a system of kinship relations that borders on the mystical. Dracons have a flair for genealogy, and through a long series of questions and answers can trace one dracon to another in a fashion that determines who rules the dracon herd. Cynical nondracons believe that the dracons make up such relationships on the spur of the moment, relating old slights and favors in their attempts to determine precedence. If such is the case, this method of dealing with leadership shows that the quick-thinking and the crafty will tend to survive.
    The kaba of the herd is assisted by the shalla, or high priest. Each herd, no matter how small, has a shalla, usually with clerical powers. The shalla is the keeper of ritual, the advisor of the kaba, and the healer of the people, if they have such. The shalla is a cleric of level 3-12, with the more powerful shalla usually found with larger herds. An additional shalla will be present for every 30 dracons. Dracon shalla draw their spells from the following spheres: Animal, Combat, Creation, Divination, Guardian, Healing, Necromantic, Protection, and Sun.
    The dracons' faith is a pantheistic religion that worships dracon equivalents of human, dwarven, and elven gods. They have gods of war, fertility, storms, and the sea. Unlike most human gods, the dracon gods are always pictured together in a huge herd, moving together and led by the Ub-Kalla, or Full Leader. The Ub-Kalla is a god of leadership and wisdom, and knows the correct course in every situation. To be called Ub-Kalla by a dracon is considered to be a high honor, for your decision-making is compared favorably with dracon thoughts.
    When dracon herds meet, the first order of business is to determine who is the kaba of the entire group, empowered to make decisions. This is done in the odd fashion of relationships and favors exchanged between groups. There is no shame for a deposed kaba taken from his post by a new kaba that outranks him â€“ the position is a duty, and the reward for such duty is that someone more powerful will come along and give you a rest.
  Ecology: |
    The familial relationships of dracons suggests that they are all natives of the same planet, and only recently have made the first steps out into the stars. This is confirmed by the fact that most dracon ships resemble old seaborne clunkers favored by groundlings, with higher ceilings to accommodate the taller beings.
    According to the dracons, their homeworld is a dry, arid orb with two types of terrain, fast-growing grass and desert. The climate is in continual flux, such that the herds are forced to move and cooperate in order to survive. There seem to be no natural enemies on their homeworld, but there are tales of a spiderlike Dark God that lies beneath the sand and pops up to trap the youngsters that stray too far from their parents. This boogeyman may be a real creature, or the product of the herd mentality. The dracon faith makes heavy use of imagery of the Dark God as an enemy and a tempter. The semblance between this Dark God and the spiderlike neogi may be a coincidence or the result of real encounters with the slaving race. Whatever the cause, the dracons hate spiders in general and the neogi in particular.
    The dracon world has large, shallow seas, and at least one large moon. Beyond that, the dracons are reluctant to share more information about their homeworld, perhaps in fear of other races finding them. One suggestion has been made that the dracon ships encountered so far are lost, and do not know how to get back to their home. Another is that the dracons are cautious about strangers. Given a lack of known predators, it may be that there are few other creatures on their planets and they are unwilling to encourage other visitors until they are ready.
    Dracon relationships with humans, mind flayers, elves, and dwarves are cordial and curious: all these races are lumped under a word for "the deformed", and the dracons, usually very good at sorting out their own differences, often ascribe human traits to elves, and elven abilities to dwarves (they can never figure out who operates the big rock-ships). Lizard me get along very well with the dracons, and are often adopted into larger families as disabled smaller relatives. Centaurs and other similar races are considered long-lost allies as well. They hate the neogi, putting dracons in good stead with other races, but consider the beholders comical. Beholder jokes make the rounds among dracons, comparing them to large kickbacks used in ritual games on their home world. How long this situation lasts remains to be seen. The race of dracons holds dragons in awe. The shalla have declared dragons to be messengers of their gods, and their actions are watched carefully for signs of the gods' wants or intentions.

  Description: |
    The realm of dreams is a dark, mysterious place in the mind of every dreamer. Something in the nature of wildspace lets certain beings use dreams as a portal, allowing them the chance to depart the immaterial world and walk in the real world. The dreamslayer looks for sleeping spelljammers and attacks them through their dreams.
    When seen in a dream, the dreamslayer's most common form is a black-shrouded humanoid figure. Its covered face is the face of the dreamer, though its eyes are glowing white sockets, and the facial features are twisted into a look of pure evil.
    A dreamslayer can also appear as the living thing the dreamer fears most, or in its true form: a 7'-tall bipedal lizard torso, glistening black, with a 3'-long tail, talons, and a pair of draconian wings. The face is a glowing, featureless white oval.
  Combat: |
    When the dreamslayer encounters a sleeping victim in wildspace, the beast attempts to enter the victim's dreams. The circumstances of a character's dreams are up to the DM.
    The dreamslayer always seeks a dream featuring other people, such as family or friends that the dreamer misses. A typical dream features 1d6 of these "dreamfolk". The dreamer sees the dreamslayer enter the dream. To weaken the dreamer's will, the dreamslayer takes control of the dream and "slays" the dreamfolk in gruesome ways. With each slaying, the dreamer (who can only watch, not act) saves vs. spell; a roll of 20 means the dreamer awakens, driving the dreamslayer back into the Astral Plane. A normal save means that the dreamer neither weakens nor awakens. Failure to save drains 2 points of Intelligence from the dreamer.
    After all the dreamfolk are "killed", the dream scenery vanishes, replaced by a barren gray plain. The dreamslayer advances to kill the dreamer. If the dreamer saved successfully, he can conjure one weapon or possession for every 3 points of Intelligence remaining; if the dreamer is a spellcaster, he selects one spell per 2 points of Intelligence left. If the dreamer failed to save, he has nothing but a nightshirt. In either case, use the dreamer's normal statistics for combat. Spells and items must be chosen before the battle is joined.
    The dreamslayer attacks once per round, making a normal attack roll. If the dreamslayer hits, the victim loses 2 points of Intelligence. When the victim reaches zero, see below.
    Each round that the dreamslayer hits, the victim must save vs. spell, with a cumulative -1 die roll penalty for each hit the dreamslayer has already made (including those on the dreamfolk). A victim who saves can try to awaken instead of attacking, using the saving throw and Intelligence check procedure described above. A victim who wakes up recovers the lost Intelligence at a rate of 1 point per 10 minutes of rest.
    A dreamslayer can only be attacked inside a dream, and then only by the dreamer. It cannot attack physically.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Dreamslayers have no society or organization. Dreamslayers are not found on planets nor in the phlogisto . They wander the Astral Plane, looking only for dreamers to inhabit.
    If a dreamslayer reduces its victim to zero Intelligence, it takes over the body for one day per point of the victim's original Intelligence. During this time, the dreamslayer does everything denied to insubstantial forms. It eats and drinks to excess and tries to experience anger, love, thrills, fear, and joy. Detect evil cast on the host shows strong evil. ESP reveals an alien mind. Know alignment shows a chaotic evil entity.
    When its time is up, the dreamslayer is hurled back to the Astral Plane, and the body collapses, dead. But if exorcise or dispel evil is cast on the victim before that time, the dreamslayer leaves the body, screaming. The victim falls into a deep sleep lasting 1d6 hours and awakens with no memory of the ordeal. Though they roam the Astral Plane, dreamslayers cannot be seen, heard, or felt. Dreamslayers only see sleeping beings; waking life is invisible to them.
  Ecology: |
    Dreamslayers contribute nothing to the ecosystem. They are the vultures of dreams, parasites of the night. Their method of reproduction, if any, is unknown.

  Description: |
    These dreaded, evil creatures were once part of the community of elves that still roam the world's forests. Now these dark elves inhabit black caves and winding tunnels under the earth, where they make dire plans against the races that still walk beneath the sun, on the surface of the green earth.
    Drow have black skin and pale, usually white hair. They are shorter and more slender than humans , seldom reaching more than 5 feet in height. Male drow weigh between 80 and 110 pounds, and female between 95 and 120 pounds. Drow have finely chiseled features, and their fingers and toes are long and delicate. Like all elves, they have higher Dexterity and lower Constitution than men.
    Drow clothing is usually black, functional, and often possesses special properties, although it does not radiate magic. For example, drow cloaks and boots act as if they are cloaks of and boots of elvenkind , except that the wearer is only 75% likely to remain undetected in shadows or to surprise enemies. The material used to make drow cloaks does not cut easily and is fire resistant, giving the cloaks a +6 bonus to saving throws vs. fire. These cloaks and boots fit and function only for those of elven size and build. Any attempt to alter a drow cloak has a 75% chance of unraveling the material, making it useless.
    In the centuries they've spent underground, drow have learned the languages of many of the intelligent creatures of the underworld. Besides their own tongue, an exotic variant of elvish, drow speak both common and the subterranean trade language used by many races under the earth. They speak the languages of gnomes and other elves fluently.
    Drow also have their own silent language composed of both signed hand movements and body language. These signs can convey information, but not subtle meaning or emotional content. If within 30 feet of another drow, they can also use complex facial expressions, body movements, and postures to convey meaning. Coupled with their hand signs, these expressions and gestures give the drow's silent language a potential for expression equal to most spoken languages.
  Combat: |
    The drow's world is one in which violent conflict is part of everyday life. It should not be surprising then, that most drow encountered, whether alone or in a group, are ready to fight. Drow encountered outside of a drow city are at least 2nd-level fighters. (See Society note below.)
    Drow wear finely crafted, non-encumbering, black mesh armor. This extremely strong mail is made with a special alloy of steel containing adamantite. The special alloy, when worked by a drow armorer, yields mail that has the same properties of chain mail +1 to +5, although it does not radiate magic. Even the lowliest drow fighters have, in effect, chain mail +1, while higher level drow have more finely crafted, more powerful, mail. (The armor usually has a +1 for every four levels of experience of the drow wearing it.)
    Dark elves also carry small shields (bucklers) fashioned of adamantite. Like drow armor, these special shields may be +1, +2, or even +3, though only the most important drow fighters have +3 bucklers.
    Most drow carry a long dagger and a short sword of adamantite alloy. These daggers and swords can have a +1 to +3 bonus, and drow nobles may have daggers and swords of +4 bonus. Some drow (50%) also carry small crossbows that can be held in one hand and will shoot darts up to 60 yards. The darts only inflict 1-3 points of damage, but dark elves commonly coat them with poison that renders a victim unconscious, unless he rolls a successful saving throw vs. poison, with a -4 penalty. The effects last 2d4 hours.
    A few drow carry adamantite maces (+1 to +5 bonus) instead of blades. Others carry small javelins coated with the same poison as the darts. They have a range of 90 yards with a short range bonus of +3, a +2 at medium, and a +1 at long.
    Drow move silently and have superior infravision (120 feet). They also have the same intuitive sense about their underground world as dwarves do, and can detect secret doors with the same chance of success as other elves. A dark elf can only be surprised by an opponent on a roll of 1 on 1d10.
    All dark elves receive training in magic, and are able to use the following spells once per day: dancing lights , faerie fire , and darkness . Drow above 4th level can use levitate , know alignment , and detect magic once per day. Drow priests can also use detect lie , clairvoyance , suggestio , and dispel magic once per day. (See also Wizard Spells, Player's Handbook .)
    Perhaps it is the common use of magic in drow society that has given the dark elves their incredible resistance. Drow have a base resistance to magic of 50%, which increases by 2% for each level of experience. (Multi-classed drow gain the bonus from only the class in which they have the highest level.) All dark elves save vs. all forms of magical attack (including devices) with a +2 bonus. Thus, a 5th-level drow has a 60% base magic resistance and a +2 bonus to her saving throws vs. spells that get past her magic resistance.
    Drow encountered in a group always have a leader of a higher level than the rest of the party. If 10 or more drow are encountered, a fighter/mage of at least 3rd level in each class is leading them. If 20 drow are encountered, then, in addition to the higher level fighter/mage, there is a fighter/priest of at least the 6th level in both classes. If there are more than 30, up to 50% are priests and the leader is at least a 7th-level fighter/8th-level priest, with a 5th-level fighter/4th-level mage for an assistant, in addition to the other high level leaders.
    Dark elves do have one great weakness â€“ bright light. Because the drow have lived so long in the earth, rarely venturing to the surface, they are no longer able to tolerate bright light of any kind. Drow within the radius of a light or continual light spell are 90% likely to be seen. In addition, they lose 2 points from their Dexterity and attack with a -2 penalty inside the area of these spells. Characters subject to spells cast by drow affected by a light or continual light spell add a +2 bonus to their saving throws. If drow are attacking a target that is in the area of effect of a light or continual light spell, they suffer an additional -1 penalty to their attack rolls, and targets of drow magical attacks save at an additional +1. These penalties are cumulative (i.e., if both the drow and their targets are in the area of effect of a light spell, the drow suffer a -3 penalty to their attack rolls and the targets gain a +3).
    Because of the serious negative effects of strong light on the drow, they are 75% likely to leave an area of bright light, unless they are in battle. Light sources like torches, lanterns, magical weapons, or faerie fire spells do not affect drow.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Long ago, dark elves were part of the elven race that roamed the world's forests. Not long after they were created, though, the elves found themselves torn into rival factions â€“ one following the tenets of evil, the other owning the ideals of good (or at least neutrality). A great civil war between the elves followed, and the selfish elves who followed the paths of evil and chaos were driven into the depths of the earth, into the bleak, lightless caverns and deep tunnels of the underworld. These dark elves became the drow.
    The drow no longer wish to live upon the surface of the earth. In fact, few who live on the surface ever see a drow. But the dark elves resent the elves and faeries who drove them away, and scheme against those that dwell in the sunlight.
    Drow live in magnificently dark, gloomy cities in the underworld that few humans or demihumans ever see. They construct their buildings entirely out of stone and minerals, carved into weird, fantastic shapes. Those few surface creatures that have seen a dark elf city (and returned to tell the tale) report that it is the stuff of which nightmares are made.
    Drow society is fragmented into many opposing noble houses and merchant families, all scrambling for power. In fact, all drow carry brooches inscribed with the symbol of the merchant or noble group they are allied with, though they hide these and do not show them often. The drow believe that the strongest should rule; their rigid class system, with a long and complicated list of titles and prerogatives, is based on the idea.
    They worship a dark goddess, called Lolth by some, and her priestesses hold very high places in society. Since most drow priests are female, women tend to fill nearly all positions of great importance.
    Drow fighters go through rigorous training while they are young. Those who fail the required tests are killed at the program's conclusion. That is why dark elf fighters of less than 2nd level are rarely seen outside a drow city.
    Drow often use giant lizards as pack animals, and frequently take bugbears or troglodytes as servants. Drow cities are havens for evil beings, including mind flayers , and drow are allied with many of the underworld's evil inhabitants. On the other hand, they are constantly at war with many of their neighbors beneath the earth, including dwarves or dark gnomes (svirfneblin) who settle too close to a drow city. Dark elves frequently keep slaves of all types, including past allies who have failed to live up to drow expectations.
  Ecology: |
    The drow produce unusual weapons and clothing with quasi-magical properties. Some scribes and researchers suggest that it is the strange radiation around drow cities that make drow crafts special. Others theorize that fine workmanship gives their wonderfully strong metals and superior cloth its unique attributes. Whatever the reason, it's clear that the drow have discovered some way to make their clothing and weapons without the use of magic.
    Direct sunlight utterly destroys drow cloth, boots, weapons, and armor. When any item produced by them is exposed to the light of the su , irreversible decay begins. Within 2d6 days, the items lose their magical properties and rot, becoming totally worthless. Drow artifacts, protected from sunlight, retain their special properties for 1d20+30 days before becoming normal items. If a drow item is protected from direct sunlight and exposed to the radiations of the drow underworld for one week out of every four, it will retain its properties indefinitely.
    Drow sleep poison, used on their darts and javelins, is highly prized by traders on the surface. However, this poison loses its potency instantly when exposed to sunlight, and remains effective for only 60 days after it is exposed to air. Drow poison remains potent for a year if kept in an unopened packet.
  Drider: |
    These strange creatures have the head and torso of a drow and the legs and lower body of a giant spider. Driders are created by the drow's dark goddess. When a dark elf of above-average ability reaches 6th level, the goddess may put him or her through a special test. Failures become driders.
    Driders are able to cast all spells a normal drow can use once per day. They also retain any magical or clerical skills they had before transformation. A majority of driders (60%) were priests of 6th or 7th level before they were changed; all other driders were mages of 6th, 7th, or 8th level.
    Driders always fight as 7 Hit Die monsters. They often use swords or axes, though many carry bows. Driders can bite for 1d4 points of damage, and those bitten must save vs. poison with a -2 penalty or be paralyzed for 1-2 turns.
    Because they have failed their goddess's test, driders are outcasts from their own communities. Driders are usually found alone or with 2d6 huge spiders (10% chance), rather than with drow or other driders. They are violent, aggressive creatures that favor blood over all types of food. They stalk their victims tirelessly, waiting for the right chance to strike.

  Description: |
    Matter and energy are seldom annihilated. The magical energy used to propel spelljamming ships produces its own "exhaust" trail, invisible to the eye but detectable by detect magic . This energy sometimes forms into a sentient monster called a dweomerborn. These bizarre creatures wander the spacelanes of wildspace feeding on magical energy. They look especially for spelljamming ships.
    Dweomerborn appear as warped, distorted humanoid phantoms, 8' tall, with long, delicate fingers. Each finger is tipped with a long talon-like fingernail. They cannot speak.
  Combat: |
    When a dweomerborn finds a spelljammer, it tries to "hitch a ride" by diving to the shipâ€™s stern and riding its exhaust trail. The dweomerborn can work its way up this exhaust, like a rope, to the stern of the ship. To do so, it must make a Dexterity check. Most dweomerborn have a Dexterity of 12 + 1d6.
    Consider a ship's stream to be 60 + 6d20 feet in length. The dweomerborn clings to the end of the stream and begins working its way up. To an observer at the ship's stern, it appears that a small patch of fog is following the ship, closing with it at 60' per round. Once within arm's length of the ship, its claws grip the hull, and it climbs aboard.
    The dweomerborn also uses its claws to defend itself if pressed, doing 1d12 damage per hand. When the dweomerborn uses its claws for combat, it lets go of the ship's deck.
    All dweomerborn have the following innate spell like abilities, each usable seven times a day: detect magic , identify , invisibility , know school , and gaseous form , all cast at 10th level.
    The dweomerborn drains spellcasters, magical items, and other sources of magic (except artifacts, relics, and helms ). Magical items must save vs. electricity. Failure means the item loses its magic permanently. A dweomerborn's successful wrestling attack on a spellcaster inflicts normal wrestling damage, and the victim also loses one spell! (Choose the spell randomly, levels notwithstanding.)
    Once a dweomerborn gets 20 spell levels of energy, it jumps off the ship, sated for the next 24 hours. Magical items supply spell levels equal to the item's XP value divided by 100 (minimum 1).
    If a dweomerborn touches a rod of cancellation or wand of negation , the monster must save vs. death at -2 or die. A successful save means it takes 2d10 damage.
    Only magical weapons of +2 or greater enchantment can harm the monster. If a weapon scores a hit, the weapon must save vs. electricity or become non-magical.
    Due to its magical makeup, a dweomerborn is unaffected by most spells. In fact, it devours magic aimed at it, except illusion spells. The dweomerborn are affected normally by all illusions, including phantasms. Sages speculate that this happens because illusions are insubstantial and leave nothing behind. (Even a divination spell leaves something behind â€“ the knowledge it imparts.)
  Habitat/Society: |
    Dweomerborn care nothing for treasure. They simply wander wildspace, singlehandedly seeking new sources of magic. Their bodies are living sponges, absorbing magical energy without conscious effort. They have no society or organization; each dweomerborn looks out for itself. They have no lairs, for they require no sleep.
  Ecology: |
    Dweomerborn have no function. If they do not eat the magical exhaust of spelljamming vessels, the trails simply dissipate in about a week's time with no effects. They cannot reproduce.
    All spelljamming ships except those powered by orbi , forges, furnaces, and non-magical engines can supply the energy to bring a dweomerborn into existence. The chance of giving "birth" to a dweomerborn is 1% for every two levels of the spelljammer; roll the chance once per month of game time. The spellcaster is not solely responsible for the dweomerborn's creation; rather, the ship's magical exhaust provides the last bit necessary for a birth.
    Some speculate that since most spellcasters are humanoid and since most spells are stored in huma brains, there is a sort of "racial memory" that causes the dweomerborn to take humanoid form.

elemental:
  Summary:
    A elemental is a creature that can be encountered in the Spelljammer campaign setting.
  Elemental, General Information (2nd Edition): |
    Elementals are sentient beings that can possess bodies made of one of the four basic elements that make up the Prime Material plane â€“ air, earth, fire, or water. They normally reside on an elemental Inner Plane and will only be encountered on the Prime Material plane if they are summoned by magical means. (See the Manual of the Planes for more information on the nature of the various elemental planes.) Each elemental must adopt a shell in the Prime Material composed of the basic element it represents, and once this shell is destroyed, the elemental will return to its native plane. While there are many more powerful and more intelligent residents of the elemental planes, the common elemental is the easiest to contact, and therefore the most frequently summoned.
    Their magical nature gives elementals great protection from attacks on the Prime Material plane. Elementals are not harmed by any nonmagical weapons or magical weapons of less than +2 bonus. Creatures with under four Hit Dice and without any magical abilities cannot harm an elemental either. (Magical abilities include such characteristics as breath weapons, poisons, paralysis, or even being immune to normal weapon attacks.) Orcs , for example, are powerless against a conjured elemental unless one happens to possess a weapon with +2 or better bonus to hit.
    Though elementals do enjoy protection from many nonmagical attacks in the Prime Material plane, like all extraplanar and conjured creatures, elementals are affected by protection from evil spells. An elemental cannot strike a creature protected by this spell and must recoil from the spell's boundaries. However, the elemental can attack creatures protected by the spell as long as it doesn't touch them. For example, a fire elemental could set the ground on fire around the creature and wait for the blaze to spread.
    Each of the four types of common elemental has its own particular strengths and weaknesses, attack modes and method of movement, depending on its plane of origin. These will be covered individually, by elemental type, in the next few pages. All common elementals share one major characteristic, however. They are basically stupid. This low intelligence makes it difficult for the elemental to resist a magical summons. But even the common elemental is bright enough to know it does not like being taken off of its home plane and held in the Prime Material plane.
  Summoning an Elemental: |
    There are three basic ways to call an elemental to this plane, and the strength of the conjured elemental depends on the method used to summon it:
    Obviously, the type of wizard or priest spell used to contact an elemental will greatly effect the size of the creature on this plane. (See the Player's Handbook for specifics.) Also, a conjured elemental's height (in feet) is equal to its Hit Dice, so the method of summoning an elemental to the Prime Material Plane will also determine its size.
    Each individual's use of any spell, staff, or device in contacting the elemental planes produces a unique call. This unique summons will only be answered by the inhabitants of a particular plane once per day. Therefore, each of the methods of summoning elementals â€“ spell, device, and staff â€“ can be used by one person to call only one of any specific type of common elemental per day. If a staff is used four times in one day, for example, all four types of elementals must be called once.
    The only exception to this is a character using more than one method to call elementals. Then, the conjurer can call a number of elementals of the same type equal to the number of methods he or she uses. This means a person with a device and a staff can summon two earth elementals. However, a person with two staffs can still summon only one elemental of any specific type in one day.
  Controlling an Elemental: |
    Because the elemental will be furious at being summoned to this plane, concentration in conjuring the creature is vital. In calling an elemental, a person must remain perfectly still and focus all of his attention on controlling the being. Any distraction to the summoner, either mental or physical, will result in a failure to control the elemental when it arrives on the Prime Material Plane. Elementals that are uncontrolled and acting upon their own desires are called free-willed. If the party is lucky, a free-willed elemental will immediately return to its plane. However, this occurs only 25% of the time.
    In most cases (75% of the time), an uncontrolled elemental will immediately attack the person or party who conjured it, also destroying anything that stands between it and its enemies. There is no way to gain control of the elemental once it is lost, and there is nothing the objects of the elemental's wrath can do but defend themselves. The elemental's intense dislike of being away from its home plane is the only safeguard those conjuring an elemental can rely upon if the elemental runs wild. Because remaining on the Prime Material Plane is painful to any common elemental, the uncontrolled elemental will always return to its plane of origin three turns after control is lost, whether it has destroyed the creatures responsible for calling it away from its elemental abode or not.
    There is always a 5% chance per round that an elemental is in the Prime Material (beginning with the second round) that the creature will break control and attack the person who summoned it. Also, if a person is wounded, killed, or loses concentration while controlling an elemental, the creature will become free-willed. The elemental will first attack the person who summoned it and then destroy any living thing it can find during the three turns after control is lost. The creature will then return to its home in the Inner Planes. A free-willed elemental can be sent to its home plane if a dismissal spell is cast upon it, but there is only a 50% chance of success for the spell in this situation.
    A successfully controlled elemental will stay on the Prime Material only for the duration of the spell that summoned it, and it can be controlled from a distance up to 30 yards per level of the person who summoned it. If under control, an elemental can be dismissed by the summoner when its task is complete.
  Stealing Control of an Elemental: |
    Control of a conjured elemental can be stolen from the person who summoned it by casting dispel magic specifically at the magical control over the creature (not the elemental itself or the person controlling it). Most of the normal rules for dispelling magic apply (see the Player's Handbook p. 148). However, when dealing with control over an elemental, a roll of 20 by the person attempting the spell means that all control has been dispelled and the creature is now free-willed.
    If control of the elemental is stolen, the creature will follow the wishes of the new person controlling it as if he or she summoned it in the first place. If the dispel magic fails, the elemental will immediately be strengthened to its maximum 8 hit points per die and the conjurer's ability to control the elemental will be greatly enhanced, making any new attempts to steal control of the creature impossible. Also, the elemental will recognize the person who sought to take control of its will as a threat. If the person currently guiding the creature loses control, the elemental will immediately attack the person who attempted to steal control of its will â€“ even before attacking the person who first summoned it.

  Air Elemental: |
  Description: |
    Air elementals can be conjured in any area of open air where gusts of wind are present. The common air elemental appears as an amorphous, shifting cloud when it answers its summons to the Prime Material plane. They rarely speak, but their language can be heard in the high-pitched shriek of a tornado or the low moan of a midnight storm.
  Combat: |
    While air elementals are not readily tangible to the inhabitants of planes other than its own, they can strike an opponent with a strong, focused blast of air that, like a giant, invisible fist, does 2-20 points of damage. The extremely rapid rate at which these creatures can move make them very useful on vast battlefields or in extended aerial combat. In fact, the air elemental's mastery of its natural element gives it a strong advantage in combat above the ground. In aerial battles, they gain a +1 to hit and a +4 to the damage they inflict.
    The most feared power of an air elemental is its ability to form a whirlwind upon command. Using this form, the air elemental appears as a truncated, reversed cone with a 10 foot bottom diameter and 30 foot top diameter. The height of the whirlwind depends on the Hit Dice of the elemental. An air elemental of 8 Hit Dice will produce a whirlwind standing 40 feet tall; a 12 Hit Dice elemental produces a whirlwind standing 60 feet tall; and a 16 Hit Dice elemental produces a whirlwind standing 80 feet tall. It takes one full turn to form and dissipate this cone.
    This whirlwind lasts for one melee round, sweeps away and kills all creatures under 3 Hit Dice in the area of its cone, and does 2-16 points of damage to all creatures it fails to kill outright. If, because of overhead obstructions, the whirlwind fails to reach its full height, it can only sweep up creatures under 2 Hit Dice and do 1-8 points of damage to all others in its cone.
  Earth Elemental: |
  Description: |
    Earth elementals can be conjured in any area of earth or stone. This type of common elemental appears on the Prime Material plane as a very large humanoid made of whatever types of dirt, stones, precious metals, and gems it was conjured from. It has a cold, expressionless face, and its two eyes sparkle like brilliant, multifaceted gems. Though it has a mouth-like opening in its face, an earth elemental will rarely speak. Their voices can be heard in the silence of deep tunnels, the rumblings of earthquakes, and the grinding of stone on stone.
    Though earth elementals travel very slowly, they are relentless in the fulfillment of their appointed tasks. An earth elemental can travel through solid ground or stone with no penalty to movement or dexterity. However, these elementals cannot travel through water: they must either go around the body of water in their path or go under it, traveling in the ground. Earth elementals prefer the latter as it keeps them moving, more or less, in a straight line toward their goal.
  Combat: |
    Earth elementals will always try to fight on the ground and will only rarely be tricked into giving up that advantage. Because of their close alliance to the rock and earth, these elementals do 4-32 points of damage (4d8) whenever they strike a creature that rests on the ground.
    Against constructions with foundations in earth or stone, earth elementals do great damage, making them extremely useful for armies sieging a fortification. For example, a reinforced door, which might require a few rounds to shatter using conventional methods, can be smashed with ease by an earth elemental. They can even level a small cottage in a few rounds.
    An earth elemental's effectiveness against creatures in the air or water is limited; the damage done by the elemental's fists on airborne or waterborne targets is lessened by 2 points per die (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die).
  Fire Elemental: |
  Description: |
    Fire elementals can be conjured in any area containing a large open flame. To provide a fire elemental with an adequate shell of Prime Material flame, a fire built to house an elemental should have a diameter of at least six feet and reach a minimum of four feet into the air.
    On the Prime Material Plane, a fire elemental appears as a tall sheet of flame. The fire elemental will always appear to have two armlike appendages, one on each side of its body. These arms seem to flicker back into the creature's flaming body, only to spring out from its sides seconds later. The only facial features of a fire elemental are two large glowing patches of brilliant blue fire, which seem to function as eyes for the elemental. Like all common elementals, fire elementals rarely speak on the Prime Material plane, though their voices can be heard in the crackle and hiss of a large fire.
  Combat: |
    Because they resent being conjured to this plane, fire elementals are fierce opponents who will attack their enemies directly and savagely, taking what joy they can in burning the weak creatures and objects of the Prime Material to ashes. In combat, a fire elemental lashes out with one of its ever-moving limbs, doing 3-24 points of damage. Any flammable object struck by the fire elemental must save versus magical fire at a -2 or immediately begin to burn.
    Fire elementals do have some limitations on their actions in the Prime Material plane. They are unable to cross water or non-flammable liquids. Often, a quick dive into a nearby lake or stream is the only thing that can save a powerful party from certain death from a fire elemental. Also, because their natural abilities give them some built-in resistance to flame-based attacks, creatures with innate fire-using abilities, like red dragons, take less damage from a fire elemental's attack. The elemental subtracts 1 point from each die of damage it does to these creature (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die).
  Water Elemental: |
  Description: |
    Water elementals can be conjured in any area containing a large amount of water or watery liquid. At least one thousand cubic feet of liquid is required to create a shell for the water elemental to inhabit. Usually a large pool serves this purpose, but several large kegs of wine or ale will do just as well.
    The water elemental appears on the Prime Material Plane as a high-crested wave. The elemental's arms appear as smaller waves, one thrust out on each side of its main body. The arms ebb and flow, growing longer or shorter as the elemental moves. Two orbs of deep green peer out of the front of the wave and serve the elemental as eyes. Like all other common elementals, water elementals rarely speak on the Prime Material Plane, but their voices can be heard in the crashing of waves on rocky shores and the howl of an ocean gale.
  Combat: |
    In combat, the water elemental is a dangerous adversary. It prefers to fight in a large body of water where it can constantly disappear beneath the waves and suddenly swell up behind its opponent. When the elemental strikes, it lashes out with a huge wave-like arm, doing 5-30 points of damage.
    Water elementals are also a serious threat to ships that cross their paths. A water elemental can easily overturn small craft (one ton of ship per Hit Die of the elemental) and stop or slow almost any vessel (one ton of ship per hit point of the elemental). Ships not completely stopped by an elemental will be slowed by a percentage equal to the ratio of ship's tons over the hit points of the attacking elemental.
    Though the water elemental is most effective in large areas of open water, it can be called upon to serve in a battle on dry land, close to the body of water from which it arose. However, the movement of the water elemental on land is the most restricted of any elemental type: a water elemental cannot move more than 60 yards away from the water it was conjured from, and 1 point of damage is subtracted from each die of damage they inflict out of the water (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die).

  Description: |
    The creatures called elmarin resemble living St. Elmo's fire. They are semisentient fire beings that live in wildspace , usually in close proximity to fire-based celestial bodies . They appear as naturally glowing balls of fire in a number of colors, ranging from deep red to light violet. Two darker spots toward the front of the orb resemble eyes.
  Combat: |
    The elmarin are drawn by warmth and energy. The activity of a spelljamming ship is such to attract a pack of them to investigate. They are often more curious than harmful, zipping about the rigging and through open hatchways, bouncing off the walls and leaving large scorch marks.
    Once in contact with flammables, however, they start inflicting damage. Each round, an elmarin can cause flammables within 5 feet of it to burst into flame, starting fires throughout the ship. This is unintentional on the elmarin's part, but no less damaging. If attacked, the elmarin will attempt to escape, burning through decks and wails as it can. The elmarin's fire has no effect on stone or metal.
    If trapped, the elmarin will turn on its attacker and try to burn it. It will inflict 1-8 points of damage per round, and cause all burnable items (cloaks, scrolls, etc.) on the body to make a saving throw vs. fire or be destroyed.
    If reduced to 0 hit points, the elmarin fades into nothingness and dies. There is a 1 in 20 chance that the death of an elmarin will leave behind an ioun stone.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Elmarin are elemental creatures of fire, with little intelligence above the animal level. They enjoy the relative coolness of space above the surface of fire-based celestial bodies (such as suns ) and can often be found here dancing, bobbing, and weaving about. Ships that are attacked and damaged by the elmarin are usually the victims of the creatures' curiosity rather than maliciousness.
    The size and color of an elmarin seems unrelated to its power or whether an ioun stone will be found after its death. Profiteering gnomes in their steel ships sometimes cruise the upper reaches of stars looking for elmarin, willing to slay many to gain a few ioun stones . The sudden appearance of elmarin is a good sign to sailors trapped with a furnace drive and no magic to feed into it.
  Ecology: |
    The elmarin are natives of the elemental plane of fire, and as such will not leave the wildspace that they are in. Attempts to take them into the phlogisto will result in their immediate detonation, unless they are in a completely sealed box or extradimensional space. Such detonation will result in 1d8 fire damage for each hit die of the elmarin to all within 20 feet of the creature, and all flammable items in that area immediately catch fire (subject to saving throws), causing more detonations in the Flow.
    Elmarin reproduce by fission and are sexless. They lack the ability to move at the high speeds generated by spelljamming craft, but will drop into the air envelopes and tag a ride with passing craft.
    Attempts to domesticate the elmarin have failed, save for certain mages, who use special variations of spells that conjure and command elemental creatures. They are generally useless minions, and are feared even by the explosion-loving giff , who at least recognize their potential for causing damage.
    A legend involving elmarin goes as follows: A mage thought he had discovered a method to domesticate the elmarin and fit them into a special harness they would not burn through. He hooked the harness to a sled and commanded the elmarin to fly. This they did, on a direct course for the surface of the sun. Whether the tale is true or intended as a cautionary legend is unknown.

  Description: |
    Ephemerals are noncorporeal undead believed to be the spirits of individuals who have died in the phlogisto . They appear as dusty gray humanoids, and it is thought that their forms are not only linked to the negative material plane, but also impregnated with the essence of the phlogiston itself. This makes them vulnerable to fire, but also gives them the ability to regenerate their unliving status. Ephemerals are attracted by use of magical energy, and a passing spelljammer helm might attract a group of them.
  Combat: |
    The touch of the ephemeral inflicts 1-4 points of damage and reduces the victim's Intelligence by 1-2 points. Should the damage inflicted by an ephemeral kill a sentient humanoid, the latter will become an ephemeral in 2-8 days. Should an ephemeral drain all the Intelligence from a sentient humanoid, the body will then become the host of the ephemeral (see below).
    In hand-to-hand combat, only magical weapons have any effect on ephemerals. As undead, they are immune to sleep , charm , and hold spells, as well as cold-based attacks. They are vulnerable to fire, and always take maximum possible damage from a fire-based attack. However, since ephemerals are only found in the Flow, this type of attack is very risky. Ephemerals can regenerate 1 hit point every melee round by pulling the surrounding phlogiston into their bodies. If sealed off in some fashion from the Flow, they will be unable to regenerate. When an ephemeral reaches 0 hit points, it dissipates permanently.
    Generally, ephemerals cannot be turned, but this is the result of the inability of clerics in the Flow to contact their patron's powers. If a priest has some form of contact with his or her power, an attempt to turn ephemerals can be made, and in this case ephemerals can be turned as spectres.
    Ephemerals will attack as a pack, if possible, seeking to drain as many humanoids as possible to use as bodies. The others will be slain and cast overboard. If seriously damaged, they will break off, trailing behind the ship, and attack again when they have regained their hit points.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Ephemerals packs wander the phlogiston, the disembodied spirits of the dead or cursed who have perished in the Flow. Unable to reach their home and the rewards (or punishments) of their afterlife, they tend to be mean, petty spirits who exist only to eventually return to a final resting place.
    The living are their vessels of return, and an ephemeral will attempt to drain the mind of a single character in order to provide itself with passage to a safe sphere. Ephemerals cannot enter the crystal spheres except when controlling a living body and, if forced to do so, they will be randomly teleported deeper into the Flow.
  Ecology: |
    The origin of the ephemerals is a mystery. They might be the remains of a race of beings who managed to crack their crystal shell, letting the phlogiston into their sphere. Whatever their origin, they have propagated by preying on intelligent creatures that pass through the Flow. Me , mind flayers , and neogi have all had to battle ephemerals in their transit between the spheres.
  Ephemeral Host: |
    The physical characteristics of an ephemeral host are those of the host body. Thus, a host body vulnerable to normal weapons remains so while the ephemeral is present, and does not acquire the ephemeral's special vulnerability to fire or its ability to regenerate using phlogiston. If the host body is killed, the ephemeral can't use it. Magic that counters the magic jar spell is also effective against ephemeral occupation.
    An ephemeral within its host immediately sets about returning to a crystal sphere. This often, but not necessarily, involves slaying anyone who would stop it, including former allies. The ephemeral will use the physical abilities of the individual it takes over but cannot use any magical or special abilities. An ephemeral could take over a mind flayer, but could not use its mental blast.
    When the host enters a crystal sphere, the ephemeral will immediately flee the body, leaving it a living, mindless shell of 0 Intelligence. The body can be restored to normal Intelligence by a full wish spell, but in the meantime, it may be inhabited by other bodiless spirits unless protected by means of a protection from evil (good) spell or similar wards.

esthetic:
  Summary:
    The esthetic is a creature from the Spelljammer campaign setting.

    XP Value: 10,000 max
  Description: |
    An esthetic is a biological, symbiotic creation of the reigar ; it is used for transportation. It is essentially a living craft, capable of self-sustenance for unlimited time. It has no intelligence of its own, being totally reliant on its host, the reigar who created it.
    Each esthetic is different from all the others â€“ a direct result of the personality of the creator. The only common thread is the extremely ornate nature of the vessels. Esthetics may be bilaterally symmetrical (two halves matching, like a huma body divided from head to feet), radially symmetrical (like a starfish), or they may have no discernible symmetry.
  Combat: |
    Tactics vary because of the individual nature of each esthetic, but the basic attack is to immobilize the prey, generally using a jammerscream attack (a spell-like ability innate to each esthetic). The creature then closes with the victim, grapples, and then drives a hollow boarding spike (6d10 points of damage due to size) into the hapless victim. In the case of animal victims, the spike can be used to inject a digestive enzyme (full damage 2d12 per round, successful saving throw vs. breath weapon for half damage) that breaks down the opponent's tissues for use by the esthetic. This attack can also be used against ships, in which case the spike opens to disgorge boarding parties of helots and lakshu attack troops. (See entry on Lakshu for more detail.)
    A jammerscream attack has a range of 2,500 yards; it affects one spelljammer. This attack form seeks out and neutralizes the energy flow necessary for spelljamming . In the case of spacegoing animals and humanoid spelljammers, the effects range from a temporary cessation of spelljamming ability (similar to a migraine, spelljamming ability lost for 3d6 turns) to cerebral hemorrhage (the latter in the case of a failed saving throw vs. spell) leading to death or at least permanent brain damage. In the case of dwarve forges, a successful strike causes forge flames to expire and shovelers to writhe on the floor, grasping their heads in pain. (Note that the jammerscream is not a spell and is not available to characters.)
  Habitat/Society: |
    Esthetics have been the reigar's homes since the destruction of the reigar's planet in the Master Stroke . When the loss of their homeworld necessitated a new habitat, the reigar leaped at the opportunity to combine their pursuits of artistic perfection, their desire for ultimate personal expression, and their need for new homes. Centuries of experimentation led eventually to the birth of the esthetics.
    The esthetic protects itself from boarding action by not making obvious doors or hatches. Entry is granted by means of permeable membrane in and around the esthetic's body. Since the reigar and its creation are in a symbiotic relationship, the reigar can always enter or leave at will. However, non-reigar accompanying the creator may not be allowed this freedom, unless the reigar specifically grants it. If the reigar is off-ship for long periods, the esthetic operates according to a set of instructions given to it by its creator. Normal instructions include things like "Don't let in any strangers" and "Stay within 100 yards of this dock".
    Should a reigar die, go insane, sink into a depression, or otherwise lose its normal mental acuity, the esthetic reflects this change in mental state by physically altering its appearance (e.g., rotting, developing spiked flanges, blades, etc.) and quite often acquiring a stronger personality of its own.
    An esthetic can travel as fast as the fastest vessel known in space ( SR 7) â€“ some say even faster. The motive force is unknown, but it is thought to be at least partially provided by the conscious actions of the esthetic itself.
  Ecology: |
    Esthetics neither take from nor contribute to their surroundings, being totally self-sufficient creations. One theory states that esthetics absorb energy via photosynthesis. Another proposes that they are able to absorb particles from the atmosphere surrounding them and convert these into nutrients.
    Esthetics cannot move into the phlogisto , thereby effectively stranding the reigar inside a crystal sphere (and providing a reason for that reigar to approach a likely party for aid). How, then, do they get from one crystal sphere to another? Again, the legends take over. It is said that there are bases â€“ giant, floating, and ornate, geometric in an alien sense (i.e., completely asymmetrical) that can hold groups of reigar and their esthetics. These are purported to be able to teleport from sphere to sphere, carrying their contents with them.

  Description: |
    The Falmadaraatha (or "Fal" for short) are huge, slug-like creatures that dwell inside hollow, lifeless asteroids . They are among several races that share the title "scholars of wildspace ".
    The Fal have large, soft, pulpy bodies that change from light tan at birth to jet black at the end of life. At the fore end of their bodies, they have a pair of small sensory antennae, bulbous eyes, a massive mouth filled with sharp teeth ideal for burrowing, and a smaller mouth above it, used for speech.
    These gentle, brilliant, inoffensive giants burrow through small planets that contain no sentient life and make their lairs inside. They speak their own tongue, as well as Common and most huma , demi-human and humanoid languages.
  Combat: |
    Although the Fal find combat offensive, considering it the final refuge of the incompetent, they are perfectly capable of defending themselves with a ferocious bite that inflicts 4d8 damage.
    On an unmodified to-hit roll of 20, the Fal catches its opponent in its mouth. The Fal does not swallow, until it tries to persuade the foe to surrender in a peaceful manner. Should the foe agree to surrender, then renege on its word, the Fal attacks with no quarter. To the Fal a promise is sacred.
    All Fal are telekinetic. A Fal can lift 1,000 pounds in this way and, if it acts first, tries to neutralize an opponent by simply lifting and holding it about 30' off the floor until the opponent stops fighting. A successful hit on the Fal breaks its concentration, and the victim falls hard.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The Fal are solitary, though there is a 5% chance of encountering 1d3 of these massive beings inside one asteroid, chatting away about philosophy, metaphysics, or the state of the multiverse. As a rule, the Fal are peaceful, honest, hospitable geniuses.
    Despite this solitude, the Fal enjoy polite company, provided it does not visit often. (To a Fal more than once a year is "often".) Any alignment may visit, though the Fal are wary around chaotic evil and lawful good beings. The Fal consider these two alignments too extreme in their philosophies.
    The Fal have a well-deserved reputation as some of the best sages in the multiverse. They answer questions in exchange for gifts worth more than 100 gp, anything from a bottle of fine wine to a book or a painting. Unlike normal sages, however, the Fal do not limit themselves to one or two subjects. This, they say, denies the opportunity to learn all the multiverse has to offer. Hence, any question asked of a Fal may be answered immediately (30% chance), within 1d10 days (30% chance), in 1d10 months (30%), or 1d10 years (10%) â€“ but, if answerable, it will be answered.
    The Fal lair (called a tcha ) is surprisingly comfortable. Most Fal decorate the tcha with accurate maps of planets and regions of space, massive bookshelves, and little trinkets that grateful visitors exchange for the answer to a question. Two types of plants usually grow inside a tcha : a phosphorescent fungus for illumination, and hardy greens that make up the Fal's diet. Many Fal also enjoy fine wine and keep a well-stocked "cellar". Predominant in the tcha are books â€“ lots of books, old and new, in different languages.
    The Fal live at least 2000 years. To them, a year is like a day, so they take things slowly. Many people mistakenly think the Fal stupid, since the slugs talk so slowly. They believe hasty words bring bad results.
    The Fal often associate with the Gonn for discourse and the arcane for research material and books. The Fal are suspicious of Aperusa , but they delight i tinker gnomes.
    The Fal venerate three gods above all others: Deneir, Thoth, and Oghma.
  Ecology: |
    There is no romance in the Fal society. The Fal are hermaphroditic, each Fal responsible for creating a "pupil" at some point, tutoring it, and sending it on its way. No one has ever seen a Fal pupil, however. It is possible that the Fal do not take questions when they are training a pupil.

  Description: |
    Feesu are large, space-going moths that travel in swarms that are a great nuisance to space travellers. Many spelljamming sailors consider them bad luck, with good reason.
    A flock of feesu appear as a mass of giant moths bathed in a sphere of soft phosphorescent green light. Individual feesu look like groundling moths. Like all moths, feesu are attracted to light.
  Combat: |
    Feesu are not known for combat, though as explained below, combat seems to follow them! However, if provoked by repeated attacks against the swarm, a moth attacks with tiny jaws that cause 1 hp damage. Since the feesu's bodily fluids are phosphorescent, the wound glows eerie green for 2d12 hours.
    Feesu save at -2 vs. fire attacks. Due to their soft bodies, blunt weapons are ineffective against them, but edged weapons do +1 hp damage.
    The feesu's most insidious attack is unconscious. Since they require air to survive, their wings trap and store air. Thus, when feesu leave a spelljamming ship, they inadvertently pull away one day's worth of air per feesu that escapes.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The feesu travel in tight swarms that hold a thick globe of air, enough to allow survival for 1d10 weeks. They refresh this air by swooping down on spelljamming ships and flying off.
    The feesu instinctively seek sources of bright light, perhaps to recharge the phosphorescent glow in their bodily fluids. Hence they fly headlong toward any major light source, including blazing suns . After one turn within 5' of a bright light source such as any form of light spell, lantern, or light-producing magical item, the feesu is "recharged" for 24 hours.
    During this recharging period, the air around the feesu swarm in a 10' radius is glowing with the intensity of bright sunlight. If a character tries to drive off the swarm by waving a weapon or shouting, the swarm makes a single morale check. Failure makes the swarm take wing, but they hover within 120' of the light with the patience of the single-minded, lingering for days until recharging.
    The problem with the feesu swarm is that its glowing cloud near the ship creates a signal beacon for monsters and raiders. The likelihood of an encounter in this situation increases to 10%. For this reason, Pirates of Gith and other raiders find the feesu useful, since their tell-tale recharging glow often means a ship is nearby. This may contribute to the superstition that feesu bring bad luck. Curiously, the Aperusa consider the feesu good luck.
    After 24 hours, the feesu's glow slowly fades to a dim flicker inside its translucent, sickly-green body. Feesu do not suffer if they cannot get recharged. But in this condition, the swarm insists on getting light, and their morale increases to Fanatic (18).
    Feesu cannot be trained, though communication is possible via magical spells. From there, the caster's negotiating skills determine whether the feesu cooperate.
  Ecology: |
    Feesu lair in the shattered hulks of space wrecks. The gravity of planets makes them uncomfortable, for it inhibits their flight. Feesu do not collect treasure.
    Feesu lay 10d10 eggs every three months. Though most of these egg-laying activities occur in the safety of their lairs, feesu are not particular, occasionally laying eggs in out-of-the-way corners of smelljamming ships.
    The feesu's bodily fluids are sometimes used to create a phosphorescent pigment. When exposed to a strong light source, the paint glows with the strength of a normal light spell for one hour. Spelljammers find this useful for travel in the phlogisto . Tinker gnomes , never known for doing things the easy way, trap feesu in elaborate cages and use the moths themselves for light while in the phlogiston.

  Description: |
    Firebirds match the description of giant eagles â€“ 10-20' wingspan, large claws, sharp hooked beak â€“ but they are not as intelligent, and a beautiful orange-yellow flame envelops them. Their eyes glow a painfully bright blue-white.
  Combat: |
    Like its terrestrial cousins the giant eagles, the firebird uses its claws and beak as primary weapons. In a diving attack, its normal 1d8/1d8 damage is doubled, and it adds +6 to its attack roll. A successful hit also inflicts 12d6 burning damage. These giant birds swoop down on unfortunate ships, snatching sailors off decks and igniting the ships' sails. They are particularly fond of gnomish vessels; they use a blowtorch-like tongue of fire to cut their way into the hulls in search of both giant space hamsters and their gnomish handlers.
    The envelope of fire that gives the firebird its name creates a zone of blast-furnace heat in a 10' radius, making melee combat impossible without magical protection. This flame sheath also renders firebirds impervious to normal missiles, since their intense heat instantly vaporizes the objects. Large missile weapons do only half damage to the firebird. Only magical weapons of +1 or better can damage a firebird. The weapons must make a saving throw vs. magical fire or be destroyed. The firebird's fire, generated internally, serves as propulsion ( SR 10).
    In addition to its flame abilities, the firebird also possesses keen eyesight. Adventurers have only a 5% chance of surprising a firebird. Even in its lair this is true, since mated pairs of firebirds roost in shifts, one keeping watch while the other sleeps.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Firebirds prefer to nest in asteroids , but are equally at home in the hulks of gnomish spaceships. Using their flame tongue ability, they hollow out the stone or metal, blowing the molten liquid with rapid beats of their wings into fantastic free-form nests. The nests are then lined with the shed feathers of the parents. These feathers glow like burning embers, providing heat for the firebird eggs and hatchlings. In each nest there is a 50% chance that 1-4 eggs are present, and a 25% chance of 1-4 young.
    Like eagles, they continually add to their nests until they die. Occasionally, firebirds link their nests into rookeries for mutual defense and care, generally in the vicinity of liveworlds or asteroid reefs where potential prey is plentiful. Any treasure in a firebird nest is magical, since only magical items or devices can stand the birds' extreme heat. There is a 10% chance that 1d4 random magic items have melted into the nest's structure. Due to the magical nature of the firebird's flame, the magic in the items transfers to the structure of the nest. For instance, a ring of protection melted into the nest makes it more resistant to damage.
  Ecology: |
    Firebirds fill an ecological niche similar to that of a hawk or eagle, feeding on small pests. Unfortunately for star travelers, the firebird considers the crews of spelljammers "small pests". The advent of spelljamming humans and demihumans has provided firebirds with tender pre-packaged meals that are fairly easy to catch.
    One other firebird attribute attracts adventurers: Their feathers are ingredients of elixirs of life . Shed feathers can fetch up to 1,000 gp apiece. An adult firebird has 1d3Ã—10 usable feathers.

  Description: |
    Fireliches are high-level evil mages whose bodies were prepared for lichdom upon their death. Such mages, either through ignorance (such as in casting fire spells) or spell failure, exploded in the phlogisto . The lich -preparation spells in their bodies turned them into living fireballs of undeath, racing through wildspace , screaming in eternal pain and looking for something to collide with, as a way to extinguish the flames.
    A firelich resembles a comet of yellow, orange, and red flames. The "head" of the comet has a skull-like face with a mouth that appears locked in a perpetual scream. The "head" measures 6' in diameter, with a fiery tail 18' long trailing behind it. It has no limbs.
  Combat: |
    Unlike its groundling brethren, a firelich goes out of its way to find confrontation. Its blazing eyes always seek spelljamming ships, in the same way that a person on fire would look for water or a blanket.
    The first sign that a firelich is in the area is its luminous, fiery appearance, followed by an ear-splitting shriek of pain. Viewers must save vs. spell at -2 (Wisdom bonuses allowed). Those who fail are frightened as though by fear . Those who succeed still take -2 to their attacks for the rest of the encounter.
    The firelich attacks by plunging headlong into the ship in a screaming dive. It makes an attack roll to hit. Treat the initial impact as a greek fire attack ( Concordance of Arcane Space , p. 57).
    After the initial damage, the ship's deck must make an item saving throw vs. magical fire. If the deck succeeds, see below. If the deck fails, the firelich has crashed below decks creating a hole 2d6+6 feet in diameter. The firelich flies downward, striking the shipâ€™s inner hull. If this hull fails another saving throw vs. spells, the firelich has made another hole and flown clear through the ship, its fire still burning strongly. In frustration, the firelich shrieks and flies off.
    Any time a natural 1 is rolled on the ship's saving throw, a wall of fire (as the 4th-level wizard spell, cast at 16th level) has sprung up on the affected deck, surrounding the hole made by the firelich. The ship also suffers a Critical Hit ( Concordance of Arcane Space , p. 59).
    If a deck's save succeeds, the firelich fails to penetrate and explodes as a fireball cast at 16th level. On the round after the explosion, the firelich's life-force recreates its comet-like body outside the ship, and the entity flees frantically through space, screaming in renewed frustration.
    Since a firelich is undead , it can be turned. It is considered a Special undead.
    Although it is a lich, the firelich cannot cast spells known in its previous existence. It has no limbs for the somatic components of a spell, and it cannot mouth words for the verbal portion.
  Habitat/Society: |
    It is unknown how the wizard gets from the phlogiston to wildspace. Since the only wizards that can become fireliches are the ones that had made previous preparations for lichdom, some guess that the arcane lich ceremonies tear a temporary hole into wildspace. The energy to create this tear may come from the explosion that created the firelich. If this is true, the hole certainly closes immediately after the firelich enters wildspace.
    Fireliches are solitary, shunning even those who share their suffering. Due to their pain and probable madness, fireliches are not communicative, though some observers have managed to coax a few fireliches to reveal their identities.
  Ecology: |
    Fireliches are an aberration in any healthy ecosystem. If it perishes, only wisps of smoke remain. Its spelljamming ability is innate and cannot be harnessed.
    A story has circulated through wildspace about a group of pirates that captured a firelich and tried to connect it to their spelljammer helm . The firelich overloaded and exploded. As the ship burned, the bits of firelich reincorporated and flew off, screaming.

  Description: |
    Sometimes travellers betwee crystal spheres fall (or are thrown) into the phlogisto flow. Most simply calcify. Some evil folk are spared this fate; a shadowy presence of great power and evil "rescues" the castaways by transforming them into smaller versions of itself. Thus the flowfiends are born.
    Flowfiends vary in height, depending on the race of the original victim; as a rule, a victim grows between a quarter and a third of its original height. Flowfiends have four muscular arms each with a powerful hand with overgrown fingernails. The flowfiend's mouth is filled with razor-sharp teeth. The creature walks upright, its body bulging with exaggerated, twisted muscles rippling under sickly yellow skin. Sometimes, the victim's previous features are still recognizable. It has its own language, a form of Common as ugly and transformed as it is.
    The flowfiend "swims" through the flow in search of food or other victims to convert. The beasts know the flow offers many spelljamming vessels travelling between the crystal spheres.
  Combat: |
    Flowfiends relish combat and waylay as many ships as possible. Their bite does 2d10 damage, but the fiends rely on their four sets of claws, each set doing 1d12 damage.
    One of the flowfiend's favorite tactics is to use two arms to pin a victim, then use its other two arms and its bite to reduce the victim to a bloody pulp. If the flowfiend gets two arm hits on one victim, the victim is pinned. A pinned character is hit automatically by the flowfiend's jaws and other arms. A pinned foe may attempt to break the beast's hold once per round, using the punching and wrestling rules in the Player's Handbook . The flowfiend has Strength 18/50.
    Note that the pin and claw/bite attacks are for victims who are ineligible for "conversion" into more flowfiends. To gain new recruits for transformation, all flowfiends can cast detect evil , detect good , detect magic , and know alignment at 7th level, though only one at a time. Only evil or chaotic neutral characters are eligible. Flowfiends attempt to pin evil victims haplessly and carry them away. If a victim fights, the flowfiend strikes it, doing non-lethal damage.
    Flowfiends sometimes use their powerful claws and jaws to grab a spelljammer hull and climb on deck. If more than three flowfiends are encountered, they attack at different parts of the ship to surround their victims. Sometimes they just toss sailors overboard to other flowfiends waiting in the flow.
    Flowfiends are immune to the calcifying process of the flow and to all hold , flesh to stone , paralyzatio , or petrificatio spells. They regenerate 2 hp each round, starting three rounds after they first take damage. A dead flowfiendâ€™s body must be burned to ashes, or it regenerates.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The flowfiends have forgotten everything about their former lives and now exist as a hunting pack eager to please their master. All flowfiends obey the mysterious entity they call " Great Father ". Scholars speculate that this is a double-strength flowfiend, probably a native of the Outer Planes. The flowfiends' greatest goal in life is to please the Great Father by bringing victims for conversion and capturing meat.
    Flowfiends take candidates for conversion to a remote spot in the flow resembling a rocky island. This is a platform built of thousands of calcified victims of the flow. The victims even make up decorative columns, a dais, and a 6Ã—6' altar.
    When victims are placed on the altar, all flowfiends in attendance begin a shrill whistling. In 1d10 hours, the Great Father appears and transforms the victim, which takes 1d4 turns. The victim makes a system shock roll; success means the birth of a new flowfiend. Failure means the victim dies. The Great Father returns to his secret lair, and the ceremony ends.
    Chaotic neutral victims turn chaotic evil. All memories of the victims' past lives give way to a new purpose: Kill and capture for the glory of the Great Father!
  Ecology: |
    Flowfiends have no gender. They add to their numbers only by getting more victims from spelljamming ships. Flowfiends require no sleep, just food.
    No one knows why the Great Father is creating flowfiends. Some speculate that the monster plans to conquer wildspace.

  Description: |
    Focoids are a severe navigational hazard near the brighter stars of the Known Sphere. They manipulate their gelatinous bodies into lenses, focusing intense light on any object they choose, thus roasting enemies and lighting rigging and decks on fire almost at will. In many ports, adventurers can receive bounties, up to 500 gp, for every focoid carcass they bring in.
    Focoids consist of three clear gelatin spheres that are joined into a short chain. They are so close to transparent that they are difficult to see unless they are moving against the star field behind them, in which case the refraction of starlight gives the observer a vague notion of where they are. They are especially difficult to see when between the observer and a bright star, not surprisingly the focoid's favorite position of attack.
    There is a small mouth at one end of a focoid. Until its last meal is completely digested, the food can be seen through the creature, temporarily rendering it visible.
    Each spherical action of a focoid's body can be manipulated into various shapes. In its combat posture, the spheres are flattened into lenses. At other times the body sections may be elongated, squashed, or left as spheres. These shape variations may indicate some kind of communication or mood changes.
  Combat: |
    A focoid's mouth is completely unsuited for combat. The creature's only means of attack is by focusing light through its lens-shaped body sections. Obviously, a focoid must have a bright source of light in order to attack. It is therefore seldom found away from fire bodies. On the rare occasions that a focoid does travel in deep space , it cannot attack and therefore most likely goes unnoticed.
    Each of the focoid's three body sections can become a lens and can fire at a separate target. Each has five hexes (2,500 yards) range, and inflicts 1d12 points (1-2 hull points) of damage. Each section can fire once per round.
    Neither a focoid nor the focused beams of light it fires are easily seen. A typical encounter with a focoid opens as the creature attacks for one or more rounds while the confused targets attempt to get a handle on its position. All missile attacks against a focoid suffers a -3 penalty to the attack roll. Melee attacks are not affected, since a focoid is relatively easy to see close up.
    A focoid can use its light-focusing weapon only when it is between a star and the target. If it is maneuvered out of position, it cannot fire. The focoid then usually evaluates the situation, moving off if the odds are against it, pressing the attack if it thinks it can get a meal. In either case, a focoid out of position is not firing and is, therefore, impossible to locate visually.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Focoids are creatures of space â€“ living, breeding, and dying there. They are never encountered in groups. Focoids have apparently not discovered the advantages of cooperative hunting. They attack only to acquire food â€“ they have no animosity toward any particular race. However, most other spacefaring races have tremendous animosity toward focoids, since these creatures are a menace to navigation.
  Ecology: |
    A focoid is unisexual, though reproduction requires the union of three adults. Each grows a new gelatin sphere and the three are joined to create a new individual. Once the new focoid is born, all participating focoids disperse. They eat meat and attack only to obtain food.

  Description: |
    Fractines appear as two-dimensional, mirrored, trapezoidal planes. When at rest, fractines resemble vast mirrors and can be manipulated to function as excellent scrying mirrors. To do so, a spelljamming scholar must focus his willpower on the subject he wishes to view, while touching a fractine. A Wisdom check (modified by a DM-selected difficulty penalty of -1 to -10) must succeed to view the subject. Failure results in 1d10 turns of exhaustion and a 10% chance that the fractine is stirred into motion. One can examine a subjectâ€™s past, future, and weaknesses using the right techniques. However, the fractine's distorted surface may blur the results, obscuring crucial information.
    Fractines are most commonly encountered in space in an active state, tumbling or folding and refolding like a piece of origami. They react to a variety of stimuli. They are attracted to motion, loud sounds, and magical energy. However, large bursts of energy (such as a fireball or lightning bolt ) repulse fractines for 1d4 rounds. Spells affecting air can be used to control fractines. (The caster must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell each round or lose control.)
  Combat: |
    A fractine causes a variety of harmful, distortional effects. Physical attacks may be used to destroy or alter its course, but only silver or magical weapons or spells cause any damage. Furthermore, a fractine must be struck on one of its two faces to cause any damage.
    Any physical damage to a fractine causes damage to the attacker. The attacker suffers 1d4Ã—25% of the inflicted damage (round fractions up), though he receives a saving throw vs. petrification to suffer only half damage.
    Once per round there is a 1% chance per point of damage inflicted that a fractine shatters into 1d4 independent fragments, each with one-third of the remaining HD and hp (shattering releases any held creatures).
    A fractine receives a saving throw vs. any magical effect, if the effect gets past its magic resistance. If the saving throw is successful, the magical effect is redirected at random.
    A fractine attacks by falling on its targets. The fractine passes through its victims, causing 2d4 points of damage and forcing a saving throw vs. breath weapon to avoid a special effect. If the saving throw fails, roll 1d20 for the effect.
    Effect lasts 1d4 rounds.
    * Effect lasts 2d4+2 rounds.
  Habitat/Society: |
    It is not known whether fractines are intelligent creatures or merely spatial phenomena. Shattered fragments either follow divergent paths or merge once again.
  Ecology: |
    Fractines consume life, light, darkness, and magical energy. Each level, Hit Dice, spell level, and bonus provides 1 point of food. When a fractine has consumed a number of points equal to its total hit points, it leaves. Its movement rate is increased by 1 per point of light consumed and decreased by 1 per point of darkness (maximum of 24 and minimum of 1).

  Description: |
    The furnace golem is a specialized form of iron golem that weighs 6,000 lbs. It is otherwise like its cousin in appearance. Furnace golems are created without weapons, but they can pick up and use any giant-size device that they can grasp.
    Furnace golems are intelligent, speaking in slow, measured booming voices that lack all inflection and tone. Their mouths open and close, having hinged jaws, and when they speak onlookers can see a fiery glow within their mouths. Furnace golems are warm to the touch but give off no odor. Their eyes give off a dull red glow, as if heated from within. Furnace golems move with ponderous gaits that can crush floors and shake whole buildings, except when they are on thick rock foundations.
    Furthermore, furnace golems are capable of spelljamming by consuming magical items, which they place in their mouths to be destroyed by the magical, molten material within them. For every 1,000 XP that a consumed magical item is worth, the golem can spelljam for one week (tonnage = 1/10 ton; SR 2; MC B). Only one item is consumed at a time, avoiding any chance of an internal explosion as might occur in normal furnaces. Furnace golems do not leave the crystal spheres in which they are found; they explode should they enter the phlogisto (300'-radius fireball causing 36d6 points of damage to all within the radius). A huma carried along by a furnace golem into wildspace has enough air for 2d6+7 days, thanks to the golem's size.
  Combat: |
    Because of their intelligence, furnace golems are more versatile than iron golems in combat. A furnace golem may pick up a large, solid weapon (anything from a tree trunk to a giant's axe) and swing it at an opponent, gaining normal initiative and causing triple the damage that a human would do with a similar (man-sized) weapon, plus the damage bonus for having storm giant strength (+12 points). A blow from its fist causes 2d6+12 points of damage. The furnace golem may pick up and hurl boulders or similar objects up to 300 yards, inflicting 3d10 points of damage per rock; however, it can catch rocks and similar hurled objects only 10% of the time.
    A furnace golem can also grasp a man-size or smaller opponent and crush him in its mighty fingers. The opponent suffers 6d6 points of damage per round, and the golem need make no further attack rolls after the first round. The golem cannot crush an opponent and fight other foes in the same round, but it can hold an opponent tightly, preventing his escape and either fight with its free hand or catch a second victim and crush them both at the same time. The golem releases their victims when they stop struggling and appear to be dead.
    Because of its size and strength, a furnace golem may crush and batter furniture, walls, carts, fences, buildings, etc. A blow from this golem's fist is as effective against structures as a ram with a +1 bonus, as given on Table 52 in the 2nd Edition Dungeon Master's Guide , page 76. The golem is equally effective if it can grasp the object and exert force against it, tearing it apart or crushing it. In any situation, consider the golem's mass and strength when lifting, throwing, resisting, or breaking objects.
    A furnace golem is immune to all weapons but those of +3 or greater enchantment. Magical cold attacks slow it for three rounds, and magical fire attacks repair 2 points of damage per hit die of damage the attack would have caused. All other spells are ineffective. Rust monster attacks affect a furnace golem, but complete destruction of the golem releases the magical molten iron within it, creating a 60-foot-diameter pool that causes 10 points of damage per round to all within it and lasts for 1d4+4 turns.
  Habitat/Society: |
    These creatures are animated by powerful, intelligent spirits conjured up by their creators and bound to the material form of the golems. They are servitors of their creators, having no true society or habitat. The creator of a furnace golem may hold a conversation with it, leading what the golem has seen and heard recently (these being its only two senses). The golem can even offer minor speculations on events of which it is aware. Such conversation is not profound and lacks imagination, but the golem never lies and always tries to use logic. It may even converse with others who encounter it, though this does not hamper its attacks if such seem warranted. Furnace golems can carry out fairly complex instructions as could normal, willing human servants of good intelligence. They never rebel against their masters.
  Ecology: |
    Furnace golems play no part in any living ecology. Furnace golems neither eat nor sleep.

  Description: |
    Spacefaring elves use this small winged plant as personal conveyance for short-distance travel outside a spelljammer's air envelope, such as boarding actions between ships, or as emergency life-support.
    The gadabout reflexively wraps its branches around the wearer, spreads its butterfly-like "wings" and allows its wearer to fly through space in a continually refreshed air bubble. This bubble is generated when the plant takes in carbon dioxide and gives off oxygen. The photosynthetic promotion of the colorful wing-leaves even provide a nourishing syrup, which the user can drink from a flexible stalk near his or her head.
    This closed environment exists as long as the wings remain intact and there is sufficient sunlight. In the phlogisto , a continual light spell can substitute for sunlight.
  Habitat/Society: |
    As these plants remain under the elves' control, information about their growth and development is sketchy at best. The elves have only recently sanctioned gadabouts for sale to non-elven races.
    Gadabouts do not generate seeds. Therefore, each gadabout is a rare commodity. Since the plants are expensive (2,500 gp each), owners jealously guard them: no one has yet dissected one.
  Ecology: |
    Easily cared for, the gadabout requires only sunlight and occasional waters. Adventurers of any class can use the gadabout, controlling it by thought as a wizard or priest controls a helm . Scholars do not know how the elves achieved this crucial modification.
    Though gadabouts are hardy, they do not tolerate abuse well. When punctured, the entire plant undergoes rapid decomposition, turning to an evil-smelling mess within two hours.
    Gadabouts, as well as flitters , men-o-war , and armadas , are modified fruit from the starfly plant . The gadabout is arrested in the motile fruit stage, and modified further to be seedless as well as responsive to commands.
    Gadabouts live about 25 years. The central part of the plant remains the same size; the only parts that grow are the wings. As with the other elven spacefaring plants, owners must trim the wings occasionally. The central plant is flexible enough to accommodate various humanoid body types. Ogres as well as gnomes have used them.

  Description: |
    The gammaroid is a gargantuan variety of the giant snapping turtle. Like its terrestrial cousin, it has a voracious appetite and rules any territory it occupies. Its unique breeding habits have made it the source of monster legends and religious rites on many worlds.
  Combat: |
    On land or in space , the gammaroid is a fearsome opponent. In space, the gammaroid masquerades as an asteroid , allowing smaller rocks to adhere to its body by gravidic attraction. When prey happens by, its enormous head shoots forth, smashing victims with 6d4 hull points of damage from its powerful jaws. This attack can swallow small vessels whole. The bony ridges of the gammarold's beak are sharp enough to rip through ship hulls, and its claws do 1d6 hull points of rending damage on impact (or 10d6 to a living target).
    The gammaroid can also pursue fleeing prey by retracting its legs and head, rotating on its central axis, and flying at spelljamming speeds ( SR 9, maneuverability F). When this deadly missile hits a ship, the target suffers an automatic "Ship shaken" critical hit; the whirling serrated edge of the gammaroid's shell may (30% chance) cut in half or utterly destroy the ship. In atmosphere, atmospheric friction from its rapid rotation creates an enveloping fireball that causes an additional 12d6 damage. The gammaroid uses this whirling attack primarily against its favorite prey, the gossamer noble.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Gammaroids spawn on planetary bodies larger than size A. They land near geologically unstable regions, homing in on areas where the heat is near the surface (up to ten miles deep). The female digs until she reaches magma, then lays 2-8 eggs in the lava pit. When the egg laying is completed she crawls from the hole, allowing it to collapse behind her. Within 50 years, the young gammaroids hatch and tunnel upward, usually surfacing far away from the hatchery. This spawning causes great destruction to surface dwellings, and even the largest underground monsters are easy prey to the hungry hatchlings.
  Ecology: |
    The gammaroid is the undisputed master of any ecosystem it inhabits. Its only natural enemy is the gossamer noble, which it disables by cutting off the tentacles, then attacking with claws and enormous jaws. Though the gammaroid prefers the gossamer noble, it may attack spelljamming ships during times of great hunger to get at the soft, tiny mortals inside. However, the metal-and-wood canisters that hold the small feasts do not settle well with the gammaroid's palate.
    The lifespans of gammaroids are very long. Specimens with shell growth patterns indicating millennia of molts have been recorded. The shells of dead gammaroids are quite useful as spelljammer hulls, as the lightness and toughness of the shell combine to make a highly maneuverable armored vessel. They can fetch a king's ransom.

  Description: |
    Genies come from the elemental planes. There, among their own kind, they have their own societies. Genies are sometimes encountered on the Prime Material plane and are often summoned specifically to perform some service for a powerful wizard or priest. All genies can travel to any of the elemental planes, as well as the Prime Material and Astral planes. Genies speak their own tongue and that of any intelligent beings they meet through a limited form of telepathy.
  Djinni: |
  Description: |
    The djinn are genies from the elemental plane of Air. It should be noted that "djinn" is the plural form of their name, while "djinni" is the singular.
  Combat: |
    The djinn's magical nature enables them to do any of the following once per day: create nutritious food for 2d6 persons and create water or create wine for 2d6 persons; create soft goods (up to 16 cubic feet) or create wooden items (up to 9 cubic feet) of a permanent nature; create metal , up to 100 pounds weight with a short life span (the harder the metal the less time it lasts; gold has about a 24 hour existence while djinni steel lasts only one hour); create illusio as a 20th-level wizard with both visible and audible components, which lasts without concentration until touched or magically dispelled; use invisibility , gaseous form , or wind walk.
    Once per day, the genie can create a whirlwind , which it can ride or even direct at will from a distance. The whirlwind is a cone-shaped spiral, measuring up to 10 feet across at its base, 40 feet across at the top, and up to 70 feet in height (the djinni chooses the dimensions). Its maximum speed is 18, with maneuverability class A. The whirlwind's base must touch water or a solid surface, or it will dissolve. It takes a full turn for the whirlwind to form or dissolve. During that time, the whirlwind inflicts no damage and has no other effect. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni concentrates on it, moving at the creature's whim. If the whirlwind strikes a non-aerial creature with fewer than 2 Hit Dice, the creature must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon for each round of contact with the whirlwind, or be swept off its feet, battered, and killed. Hardier beings, as well as aerial or airborne creatures, take 2d6 points of damage per round of contact with the whirlwind.
    A djinni can ride its whirlwind and even take along passengers, who (like the djinni) suffer no damage from the buffeting winds. The whirlwind can carry the genie and up to six man-sized or three genie-sized companions.
    Airborne creatures or attacks receive a -1 penalty to attack and damage rolls against a djinni, who also receives a +4 bonus to saving throws against gas attacks and air-based spells.
    Djinn are nearly impossible to capture by physical means; a djinni who is overmatched in combat usually takes to flight and uses its whirlwind to buffet those who follow. Genies are openly contemptuous of those life forms that need wings or artificial means to fly and use illusion and invisibility against such enemies. Thus, the capture and enslavement of djinn is better resolved by the DM on a case-by-case basis. It is worth noting, however, that a good master will typically encourage a djinni to additional effort and higher performance, while a demanding and cruel master encourages the opposite.
    Djinn are able to carry up to 600 pounds, on foot or flying, without tiring. They can carry double that for a short time: three turns if on foot, or one turn if flying. For each 100 pounds below the maximum, add one turn to the time a djinni may walk or fly before tiring. A fatigued djinni must rest for an hour before performing any additional strenuous activity.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The djinn's native land is the elemental plane of Air, where they live on floating islands of earth and rock, anywhere from 1,000 yards to several miles across. They are crammed with buildings, courtyards, gardens, fountains, and sculptures made of elemental flames. In a typical djinn landhold there are 3d10 djinn of various ages and powers, as well as 1d10 jann and 1d10 elemental creatures of low intelligence. All are ruled by the local sheik, a djinn of maximum hit points.
    The social structure of djinn society is based on rule by a caliph, served by various nobles and officials (viziers, beys, emirs, sheiks, sheriffs, and maliks). A caliph rules all the djinn estates within two days' travel, and is advised by six viziers who help maintain the balance of the landholdings. If a landhold is attacked by a large force, a messenger (usually the youngest djinni) is sent to the next landhold, which sends aid and dispatches two more messengers to warn the next landholds; in this fashion the entire nation is warned.
  Noble Djinn: |
    Some djinn (1%) are "noble" and are able to grant three wishes to their masters. Noble djinn perform no other services and, upon granting the third wish are freed of their servitude. Noble djinn are as strong as efreet, with 10 Hit Dice. They strike for 3d8 points of damage, and the whirlwinds they create cause 3d6 hit points of damage.
  Dao: |
  Description: |
    A dao is a genie from the elemental plane of Earth. While they are generally found on that plane (though even there they are uncommon), the dao love to come to the Prime Material plane to work evil. Dao speak all of the languages of the genies, as well as Common and the tongue of earth elementals.
  Combat: |
    The dao's magical abilities enable them to use any of the following magical powers, one at a time, once each per day: change self , detect good , detect magic , gaseous form , invisibility , misdirectio , passwall , spectral force , and wall of stone . They can also fulfill another's limited wish (in a perverse way) once each day. Dao can use rock to mud three times per day and dig six times per day. Dao perform all magic as 18th-level spellcasters.
    A dao can carry up to 500 pounds without tiring. Double weight will cause tiring in three turns, but for every 100 pounds of weight under 1,000, the dao may add one turn to the duration of its carrying ability. After tiring, a dao must rest for one hour. Dao can move through earth (not worked stone) at a burrowing speed of 6. They cannot take living beings with them, but can safely carry inanimate objects.
    Dao are not harmed by earth-related spells, but holy water has twice its normal effect upon these monsters.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The dao dwell in the Great Dismal Delve on their own plane and in deep caves, caverns, or cysts on the Prime Material plane. Dao settle pockets of elemental matter on their own plane, bending those pockets to their will and desire. A dao mazework contains 4d10 dao, as well as 8d10 elemental and non-elemental slaves. Each mazework is ruled by an ataman or hetman who is advised by a seneschal. The loyalty of a mazework's ataman to the Great Dismal Delve is always questionable, but the seneschals are chosen by the khan of the dao, and their loyalty is to him alone.
    The khan of the dao lives at the center of the great mazework called the Great Dismal Delve. The land within the delve is said to be larger than most Prime Material continents. The Great Dismal Delve is linked to all manner of elemental pockets, so the khan can call forth whatever powers he needs. The population of dao in the delve is unknown, as is the number of slaves that constantly work the tunnels and clear away damage caused by the quakes which frequently shake it.
    Dao dislike servitude as much as efreet and are even more prone to malice and revenge than their fiery counterparts.
  Ecology: |
    The dao manage a thriving business of trade, driven by a desire for more power and access to precious gems. High on their list of hatreds are most other genies (except efreet, with whom they trade worked metals for minerals). They also have little use for other elemental creatures; the dao value these only if they can exploit them in some fashion.
  Efreeti: |
  Description: |
    The efreet (singular: efreeti) are genies from the elemental plane of Fire. They are enemies of the djinn and attack them whenever they are encountered. A properly summoned or captured efreeti can be forced to serve for a maximum of 1,001 days, or it can be made to fulfill three wishes. Efreet are not willing servants and seek to pervert the intent of their masters by adhering to the letter of their commands.
    The efreet are said to be made of basalt, bronze, and solid flames. They are massive, solid creatures.
  Combat: |
    An efreeti is able to do the following once per day: grant up to three wishes ; use invisibility , gaseous form , detect magic , enlarge , polymorph self , and wall of fire ; create a illusio with both visual and audio components which will last without concentration until magically dispelled or touched. An efreeti can also produce flame or use pyrotechnics at will. Efreet are immune to normal fire-based attacks, and even an attack with magical fire suffers a -1 penalty on all attack and damage rolls.
    Efreet can carry up to 750 pounds on foot or flying, without tiring. They can also carry double weight for a limited time: three turns on foot or one turn aloft. For each 150 pounds of weight under 1500, add one turn to either walking or flying time permitted. After tiring, the efreeti must rest for one hour.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Efreet are infamous for their hatred of servitude, desire for revenge, cruel nature, and ability to beguile and mislead. The efreet's primary home is their great citadel, the fabled City of Brass, but there are many other efreet outposts throughout the plane of Fire.
    An efreet outpost is a haven for 4d10 efreet and is run as a military station to watch or harass others in the plane. These outposts are run by a malik or vali of maximum normal hit points. There is a 10% chance that the outpost is also providing a temporary home for 1d4 jann or 1d4 dao (the only other genies efreet tolerate). Outpost forces are usually directed against incursions from the elemental plane of Air, but they can be directed against any travelers deemed suitable for threats, robbery, and abuse.
    Efreet are neutral, but tend toward organized evil. They are ruled by a grand sultan who makes his home in the City of Brass. He is advised by a variety of beys, amirs, and maliks concerning actions within the plane, and by six great pashas who deal with efreet business on the Prime Material plane.
    The City of Brass is a huge citadel that is home to the majority of efreet. It hovers in the hot regions of the plane and is often bordered by seas of magma and lakes of glowing lava. The city sits upon a hemisphere of golden, glowing brass some 40 miles across. From the upper towers rise the minarets of the great bastion of the Sultan's Palace. Vast riches are said to be in the palace of the sultan. The city has an efreet population that far outnumbers the great cities of the Prime Material plane. The sultan wields the might of a Greater Power, while many of his advisors are akin to Lesser Powers and Demi-Powers.
  Ecology: |
    Fire elementals tend to avoid the efreet, whom they feel are oppressive and opportunistic. Djinn hate them, and there have been numerous djinn-efreet clashes. Efreet view most other creatures either as enemies or servants, a view that does not endear them to other genies.
  Marid: |
  Description: |
    The marids are said to be born of the ocean, having currents for muscles and pearls for teeth. These genies from the elemental plane of Water are the most powerful of all genies. They are also the most individualistic and chaotic of the elemental races, and only rarely deign to serve others.
    On their own plane they are rare; marids travel so seldom to the Prime Material plane that many consider marids to be creatures of legend only.
  Combat: |
    Marids perform as 26th-level spellcasters, and can use any of the following magical powers, one at a time, twice each per day: detect evil , detect good , detect invisibility , detect magic , invisibility , liquid form (similar to gaseous form ), polymorph self , and purify water . Marids can use any of the following up to seven times per day: gaseous form , lower water , part water , wall of fog , or water breathing (used on others, lasting up to one full day). Once per year a marid can use alter reality.
    Marids can always create water , which they may direct in a powerful jet up to 60 yards long. Victims struck by the jet take 1d6 points of damage and must make a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon or be blinded for 1d6 rounds. Marids also have the innate ability to water walk (as the ring).
    A marid can carry 1,000 pounds. Double weight causes tiring in three turns. For every 200 pounds under 2,000, add one turn to the time the marid can carry before tiring. A tired marid must rest for one hour.
    Marids swim, breathe water, are at home at any depth, and have infravision. They are not harmed by water-based spells. Cold-based spells grant them a +2 bonus to saving throws and -2 to each die of damage. Fire inflicts +1 per die of damage, with saving throws at a -1 penalty. Steam does not harm them.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Marids live in a loose empire ruled by a padisha. Each marid lays some claim to royalty; they are all shahs, atabegs, beglerbegs, or mufti at the very least. There have often been several simultaneous "single true heirs" to the padisha's throne through the eons.
    A marid household numbers 2d10 and is located around loosely grouped elemental pockets containing the necessities for marid life. Larger groups of marids gather for hunts and tournaments, where individual effort is heavily emphasized.
    Marids are champion tale-tellers, although most of their tales emphasize their own prowess, and belittle others. When communicating with a marid, one must attempt to keep the conversation going without continual digression for one tale or another, while not offending the marid. Marids consider it a capital offense for a lesser being to offend a marid.
    Marids are both fiercely independent and extremely egoistical. They are not easily forced to perform actions; even if convinced through flattery and bribery to obey, they often stray from their intended course to seek some other adventure that promises greater glory, or to instruct lesser creatures on the glories of the marids.
    Most mages skilled in summoning and conjuration consider marids to be more trouble than they are worth, which accounts for the great lack of items of marid control (as opposed to those affecting efreet and djinn). Marids can travel the Ethereal plane, in addition to those planes to which all genies can travel.
  Ecology: |
    Marids tolerate their genie relatives, putting up with jann and djinn like poor cousins, while they have an aversion to efreet and dao. Their attitude toward the rest of the world is similar; most creatures from other planes are considered lesser beings, not fit to be bothered with unless one lands in the feast hall at an inopportune time.
  Janni: |
  Description: |
    The jann are the weakest of the elemental humanoids known collectively as genies. Jann are formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the Prime Material plane. In addition to speaking Common and all the languages of genies, jann can speak with animals.
  Combat: |
    Jann often wear chain mail armor (60% chance), giving them an effective AC of 2. They typically use great scimitars which inflict 2d8 damage to small and medium creatures, and 4d4 points of damage to larger opponents. They also use composite long bows. Male jann have exceptional Strength scores; roll percentile dice for their Strengths. For female jann, roll percentile dice and subtract 50; anything above 0 indicates percentage Strength equal to that number, while anything below indicates 18 Strength.
    Jann can use one the following magical powers each round: enlarge or reduce , twice each per day; invisibility three times per day; create food and water once per day as a 7th-level priest; and etherealness (as the armor) once per day for a maximum of one hour. Jann perform at 12th-level ability, except as noted.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Jann favor forlorn deserts and hidden oases, where they have both privacy and safety. Jann society is very open, and males and females are regarded as equals. A tribe is made up of 1d20+10 individuals and is ruled by a sheik and one or two viziers. Exceptionally powerful sheiks are given the title of amir, and in times of need they gather and command large forces of jann (and sometimes allied humans ).
    Many jann tribes are nomadic, traveling with flocks of camels, goats, or sheep from oasis to oasis. These itinerant jann appear human in every respect, and are often mistaken for them, unless they are attacked. Jann are strong and courageous, and they do not take kindly to insult or injury. The territory of a jann tribe can extend hundreds of miles in any direction.
    While traveling, male jann live in large, colorful tents with their wives and married male children, and their families. Married daughters move away to live with their new husbands. When a family eventually grows large enough that it can no longer reside comfortably in the tent, a new tent is built, and a son takes his wife and family with him to this new dwelling. At permanent oases, the jann live not only in tents, but also in elegantly styled structures built from materials brought from any of the elemental planes.
    Jann are able to dwell in air, earth, fire, or water environments for up to 48 hours. This includes the elemental planes, to which any janni can travel, even taking up to six individuals along if those others hold hands in a circle with the janni. Failure to return to the Prime Material plane within 48 hours inflicts 1 point of damage per additional hour on the jann, until the jann dies or returns to the Prime Material plane. Travel to another elemental plane is possible, without damage, providing at least two days are spent on the Prime Material plane immediately prior to the travel.
  Ecology: |
    Jann are suspicious of humans, dislike demihumans, and detest humanoids. Jann accept djinn, but shun dao, efreet, and marids. They sometimes befriend humans or work with them for a desired reward, like potent magical items.
    One ethic the jann share with other nomads is the cultural demand for treating guests with honor and respect. Innocent visitors (including humans) are treated hospitably during their stay, but some day might be expected to return the favor.
  Jann Leaders: |
    Jann leaders have 17-18 Intelligence, and 10% have 19 Strength. Sheiks have up to 8 Hit Dice, amirs up to 9. Viziers have 17-20 Intelligence and the following magical powers, each usable three times per day at 12th-level spellcasting ability: augury , detect magic , and divination.

  Description: |
    Ghouls are undead creatures, once huma , who now feed on the flesh of corpses. Although the change from human to ghoul has deranged and destroyed their minds, ghouls have a terrible cunning which enables them to hunt their prey most effectively.
    Ghouls are vaguely recognizable as once having been human, but have become horribly disfigured by their change to ghouls. The tongue becomes long and tough for licking marrow from cracked bones, the teeth become sharp and elongated, and the nails grow strong and sharp like claws.
  Combat: |
    Ghouls attack by clawing with their filthy nails and biting with their fangs. Their touch causes humans (including dwarves , gnomes , half-elves , and halflings , but excluding elves ) to become rigid unless a saving throw versus paralyzation is successful. This paralysis lasts for 3-8 (2+1d6) rounds or until negated by a priest.
    Any human or demi-human (except elves) killed by a ghoulish attack will become a ghoul unless blessed (or blessed and then resurrected ). Obviously, this is also avoided if the victim is devoured by the ghouls. Ghoul packs always attack without fear.
    These creatures are subject to all attack forms except sleep and charm spells. They can be turned by priests of any level. The magic circle of protection from evil actually keeps ghouls completely at bay.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Ghouls and ghasts are most frequently encountered around graveyards, where they can find plenty of corpses on which to feed.
  Ecology: |
    Ghouls (and ghasts, as described later) delight in revolting and loathsome things â€“ from which we draw our adjectives "ghoulish" and "ghastly".
  Lacedo: |
    The lacedon is a marine form of the ghoul. Lacedons are sometimes found near marine ghosts, particularly ghost ships. Lacedons are less common than ghouls because of the fewer corpses available for them to feed on, but they can often be found swarming around recent shipwrecks in rivers, lakes, and oceans.
  Ghast: |
    These creatures are so like ghouls as to be completely indistinguishable from them, and they are usually found only with a pack of ghouls. When a pack of ghouls and ghasts attacks it will quickly become evident that ghasts are present, for they exude a carrion stench in a 10' radius which causes retching and nausea unless a saving throw versus poison is made. Those failing to make this save will attack at a penalty of -2.
    Worse, the ghast shares the ghoulish ability of paralyzation, and their attack is so potent that it will even affect elves. Paralysis caused by a ghast lasts for 5-10 (4+1d6) rounds or until negated by a priest's remove paralysis spell.
    Ghasts, like ghouls, are undead class and thus sleep and charm spells do not affect them. Though they can be struck by any sort of weapon, cold iron inflicts double normal damage. Clerics can turn them beginning at 2nd level. The circle of protection from evil does not keep them at bay unless it is used in conjunction with cold iron (such as a circle of powdered iron or an iron ring).

  Description: |
    Giant space hamsters are exactly what they sound like-cute but brown-bear-sized rodents with thick fur. They are found on worlds having colonies of Krynnish gnomes (gnomoi and minoi). Giant space hamsters come in a variety of colors, but are usually golden brown with white underbellies, bands, and spots. They are well muscled but appear fat. A giant space hamster can store up to 200 lbs. of food in its cheeks.
  Combat: |
    Giant space hamsters normally have only one mode of attack â€“ a nasty bite. They avoid even this on most occasions, as domestic breeds are quite cowardly. However, wild breeds are more aggressive, and they briefly charge at anyone who approaches a burrow. Domesticated females profiting their litters also have improved morale (9). Careless gnome handlers have sometimes been bitten and (on a successful attack roll of 19 or better) stuffed into a cheek pouch, from which the gnome may escape if he rolls a successful Strength roll to open doors on a subsequent round. Trapped gnomes are merely covered in hamster spit, and are eventually spat out like old chewing gum when the hamster sees food.
  Habitat/Society: |
    A small pack of giant space hamsters consists of 1d4 adults (select the sexes by starting with a female and alternating thereafter, so a pack of three hamsters consists of two females and a male), with a 20% chance per adult female of 1d4 young being present (AC 10, MV 3, HD 1, #AT nil, Size S 3' long) and another 20% chance per adult female of 1d4 juveniles being present (AC 9, MV 6, HD 2, THAC0 19, #AT 1, Dmg 1d4, Size M 6' long). Gnomes are unable to figure out how to reduce their breeding rate, aside from separating the sexes (this conclusion was suggested after a 22-year-long research program that included five gnome fatalities). Giant space hamsters can easily have several litters in one year, and they grow to breeding adulthood in but two years. These creatures live 18 years at most, and remain fertile all their adult lives.
  Ecology: |
    Giant space hamster easily fill the niche occupied by large browsing animals, such as the elephant and the rhino on Earth, though most of them lack any real means of defending themselves. In the wild, they often die out despite their extraordinary reproductive rate. They are preyed upon by large- and medium-size carnivores, but they are immune to all parasites and diseases, magical or not. Cold weather forces them to hibernate for up to six months until the weather improves.
    These creatures did not evolve naturally, as one might guess. They were created by a gnome research committee attempting to develop a relatively passive creature large enough to wind up the giant rubber bands attached to the huge running wheels inside gnomish spelljammer craft. These devices produce internal power from torque. (Teams of gnomes formerly filled this job.) The giant space hamsters produced by the committee ran for hours inside their big wheels, and were eventually spread through space.
    Gnomes have found that the meat of giant space hamsters is quite tasty. Space hamster meat is called " spaham ", and many gnomes eat large quantities of spaham with every meal. Many hamster ranches simply breed giant space hamsters as livestock.

  Description: |
    The giff are a race of powerfully muscled mercenaries. They are civilized, though they lack mages among their own race. Giff hire on with various groups throughout the universe as mercenaries, bodyguards, enforcers, and general legbreakers.
    The giff are humanoid, with stocky, flat, cylindrical legs and a humanoid torso, arms, and fingers. Its chest is broad and supports a hippopotamus head with a natural helmet of flexible, chitinous plates. Giff come in colors ranging from black to gray to a rich gold, and many have colorful tattoos that leave their bodies a patchwork record of past victories. Giff speak their own language and the Common tongue.
  Combat: |
    The giff are military-minded, and organize themselves into squads, platoons, companies, corps, and larger groups. The number of giff in a platoon varies according to the season, situation, and level of danger involved. A giff "platoon" hired to protect a gambling operation may number two, while a platoon hired to invade an illithid stronghold may number well over a hundred.
    The giff pride themselves on their weapon skills, and any giff carries a number of swords, daggers, maces, and similar tools on hand to deal with troublemakers.
    A giff's true love in weaponry is the gun. Any giff has a 20% chance of having an arquebus and sufficient smoke powder for 2d4 shots. A misfiring weapon matters little to the giff (occasional fatalities are expected); the flash, noise, and damage is what most impresses them.
    Even unarmed, the giff are powerful opponents. They are as strong as a hill giant (+7 damage adjustment for Strength). They will wade into a brawl just for the pure fun of it, tossing various combatants on both sides around to prove themselves the victors. Once a weapon is bared, the giff consider all restrictions off â€“ the challenge is to the death.
    The top of the giff's head and snout are plated with thick, chitinous plates, flexible enough to permit motion, but giving the creature a natural helmet. The giff can charge using a head butt, inflicting 2d6 points of damage.
    The giff prize themselves as mercenaries, and to that end have made elaborate suits of armor (AC 2). These include full helms with other monsters on the crests, inlaid with ivory and bone along the large plates. Armor repair is a major hobby among the giff.
    Finally, giff are somewhat magic resistant. They are deeply suspicious of magic, magicians, and magical devices.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The giff are happiest among their own race â€“ they consider larger races such as giants threatening and complain about the fragility of the smaller races. Unlike the dracons , they suffer no penalties for being apart from their fellows, but merely prefer the company of their own species. Outside their own platoons, the giff are happiest among military organizations with a strong chain of command.
    Every giff, male, female, and giffling, has a rank within society, which can only be changed by someone of higher rank. Within this rank are subranks and within those subranks are color markings and badges. The highest-ranking giff gives the orders, the others obey. It does not matter if the orders are foolish or even suicidal â€“ following them is the purpose of the giff in the universe. A quasi-mystical faith among the giff mercenaries confirms that all things have their place, and the giff's is to follow orders. This makes the giff very happy.
    Giff platoons can be hired by those looking for their muscle. The arcane do a small business in giff mercenaries, but usually local contractors perform the task. These contractors review prospective employers according to ability to pay, then make a recommendation to the giff leaders. The leaders, in turn, consider the danger of the job, and whether taking it will enhance their giffdom.
    Giff jobs are usually paid in smoke powder, though they often will accept other weapons and armor. It is purely a barter system, but to hire one giff for one standard week requires seven charges of smoke powder (one/day). In areas where smoke powder is more common, the price will rise.
    On board ship, the giff have their own quarters, and will often request to bring on their own large weapons. They favor greek fire projectors and bombards for ground work, and will happily blaze away at opponents, regardless of the tactical situation.
    The giff require the ships of others because they have no spellcasting abilities among them â€“ they are magically inert in such a way that even the serial helms of the mind flayers have no effect on them. Lifejammers are considered to be a "wizard's way to die" (a giff insult). Giff trade their services for transport and for weapons â€“ especially smoke powder.
    Giff of both sexes serve in their platoons, and both fight equally well. Giff young are raised tenderly until they are old enough to survive an exploding arquebus, then are inducted fully into the platoon.
    Giff are fierce fighters, despite their somewhat comical appearance and mania for weapons. They will not, however, willingly fight other giff. If forced into such a situation on a battlefield, both groups will retire for at least a day of drinking and sorting out ranks. There is a 10% chance that one platoon will join another in this case, but most likely both will quit their current hirings and look for work elsewhere.
  Ecology: |
    Like the dracon, the giff are surmised to have evolved from one world, which was not blessed with a wide variety of intelligent species such as elves , me , dwarves , and beholders . Sages point to the giff as an example of what happens when only one sentient species is found on a planet.
    The giff homeworld is the stuff of legend; as no living giff has seen it. Some tales say that the homeworld was destroyed by the giff, who were rescued by the arcane. Others say that the giff sold their planet and their lives to the arcane in exchange for spelljamming helms they could not use. Still others say that the giff homeworld is just beyond the range of one's ship, in a land where such warrior races are common, and the losers are exiled to the known worlds.
    Whatever the truth, the giff describe their homeworld in legendary terms â€“ a thick, verdant jungle, covered with swamps, mangrove trees, and fruit plants. The few mountains are rich in metals, caches of weapons, and smoke powder.
    The giff practice equality among the sexes in battle and in childrearing. They live about 70 years, but do not take aging gracefully. As a giff grows older and begins to slow down, he is possessed with the idea of proving himself still young and vital, usually in battle. As a result, there are very, very few old giff.
  3rd Edition Stats: |
  Giff Racial Traits: |
    Giff characters have the following stats:
    +6 Strength, -2 Intelligence, -2 Wisdom. Giff are extraordinarily powerful, but not terribly bright or perceptive.
    Large. As Large creatures, giff suffer a -1 size penalty to attack rolls and AC, and a -4 size penalty on Hide checks. They may use larger weapons than humans use, and their lifting and carrying limits are twice those of Medium-size characters. A giff also has a natural reach of 10 feet.
    Giff base speed is 30 feet.
    Natural Armor: Giff have a +4 natural armor bonus.
    Head-Butt: A giff can deliver a head-butt as a standard action, dealing 1d8 points of damage plus one and one-half his Strength bonus. A giff cannot combine a head-butt with other attacks.
    Spell Resistance: Giff are naturally resistant to magic. A giffâ€™s SR equals his effective character level plus 3. A giff cannot voluntarily lower his spell resistance, even for beneficial magic such as healing.
    Malfunctioning Magic: The giffâ€™s resistance to magic extends even to magic items worn or used by the giff. Any magic item activated via spell completion (such as scrolls), spell trigger (such as wands and staffs), or a command word or mental activation (such as a ring of invisibility) has a 10% chance of simply not functioning when activated by a giff. Thus, most giff stick to magic items that donâ€™t require such activation, such as weapons, armor, potions, and the like.
    Automatic Languages: Common and Giff. Bonus Languages: Dwarven, Elven, and Orc. Giff find it useful to know the languages of their enemiesâ€¦or their employers.
    Preferred Class: Fighter. A multiclass giff's fighter class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing. All giff are natural-born warriors.
    Level Adjustment: +2. The giffâ€™s prodigious Strength and natural armor make them significantly more powerful than a typical human. A 1st-level giff fighterâ€™s effective character level is 3.

  Description: |
    Gnolls are large, evil, hyena-like humanoids that roam about in loosely organized bands.
    While the body of a gnoll is shaped like that of a large huma , the details are those of a hyena. They stand erect on two legs and have hands that can manipulate as well as those of any human. They have greenish gray skin, darker near the muzzle, with a short reddish gray to dull yellow mane.
    Gnolls have their own language and many also speak the tongues of flinds, trolls , orcs , or hobgoblins.
  Combat: |
    Gnolls seek to overwhelm their opponents by sheer numbers, using horde tactics. When under the direction of flinds or a strong leader, they can be made to hold rank and fight as a unit. While they do not often lay traps, they will ambush or attempt to attack from a flank or rear position. Gnolls favor swords (15%), pole arms (35%) and battle axes (20%) in combat, but also use bows (15%) and morningstars (15%).
  Habitat/Society: |
    Gnolls are most often encountered underground or inside abandoned ruins. When above ground they operate primarily at night. Gnoll society is ruled by the strongest, using fear and intimidation. When found underground, they will have (30% chance) 1-3 trolls as guards and servants. Above ground they keep pets (65% of the time) such as 4-16 hyenas (80%) or 2-12 hyaenodons (20%) which can act as guards.
    A gnoll lair will contain between 20 and 200 adult males. For every 20 gnolls, there will be a 3 Hit Die leader. If 100 or more are encountered there will also be a chieftain who has 4 Hit Dice, an Armor Class of 3, and who receives a +3 on his damage rolls due to his great strength. Further, each chieftain will be protected by 2-12 (2d6) elite warrior guards of 3 Hit Dice (AC 4, +2 damage).
    In a lair, there will be females equal to half the number of males. Females are equal to males in combat, though not usually as well armed or armored. There will also be twice as many young as there are adults in the lair, but they do not fight. Gnolls always have at least 1 slave for every 10 adults in the lair, and may have many more.
    Gnolls will work together with orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears , ogres , and trolls. If encountered as a group, there must be a relative equality of strength. Otherwise the gnolls will kill and eat their partners (hunger comes before friendship or fear) or be killed and eaten by them. They dislike goblins , kobolds , giants, humans, demi-humans and any type of manual labor.
  Ecology: |
    Gnolls eat anything warm blooded, favoring intelligent creatures over animals because they scream better. They will completely hunt out an area before moving on. It may take several years for the game to return. When allowed to die of old age, the typical gnoll lives to be about 35 years old.
  Flind: |
    The flind is similar to a gnoll in body style, though it is a little shorter, and broader. They are more muscular than their cousins. Short, dirty, brown and red fur covers their body. Their foreheads do not slope back as far, and their ears are rounded, but still animal like.
    Flinds use clubs (75%) which inflict 1-6 points of damage and flindbars (25%) which do 1-4 points of damage. A flindbar is a pair of chain-linked iron bars which are spun at great speed. A flind with a flindbar can strike twice per round. Each successful hit requires the victim to save vs. wands or have his weapon entangled in the chain and torn from his grasp by the flindbar. Due to their great strength, flinds get a +1 on their attack rolls.
    Flinds are regarded with reverence and awe by gnolls. Flind leaders are 3+3 Hit Dice, at least 13 Intelligence and 18 Charisma to gnolls (15 to flinds), and always use flindbars.

  Description: |
    These small, evil humanoids would be merely pests, if not for their great numbers.
    Goblins have flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, wide mouths and small, sharp fangs. Their foreheads slope back, and their eyes are usually dull and glazed. They always walk upright, but their arms hang down almost to their knees. Their skin colors range from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red. Usually a single tribe has members all of about the same color skin. Their eyes vary from bright red to a gleaming lemon yellow. They wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward dull soiled-looking colors.
    Goblin speech is harsh, and pitched higher than that of humans . In addition to their own language, some goblins can speak in the kobold , orc , and hobgobli tongues.
  Combat: |
    Goblins hate bright sunlight, and fight with a -1 on their attack rolls when in it. This unusual sensitivity to light, however, serves the goblins well underground, giving them infravision out to 60 feet.
    They can use any sort of weapon, preferring those that take little training, like spears and maces. They are known to carry short swords as a second weapon. They are usually armored in leather, although the leaders may have chain or even plate mail.
    Goblin strategies and tactics are simple and crude. They are cowardly and will usually avoid a face-to-face fight. More often than not, they will attempt to arrange an ambush of their foes.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Humans would consider the caves and underground dwellings of goblins to be dank and dismal. Those few tribes that live above ground are found in ruins, and are only active at night or on very dark, cloudy days. They use no form of sanitation, and their lairs have a foul stench. Goblins seem to be somewhat resistant to the diseases that breed in such filth.
    They live a communal life, sharing large common areas for eating and sleeping. Only leaders have separate living spaces. All their possessions are carried with them. Property of the tribe is kept with the chief and sub-chiefs. Most of their goods are stolen, although they do manufacture their own garments and leather goods. The concept of privacy is largely foreign to goblins.
    A typical goblin tribe has 40-400 (4d10Ã—10) adult male warriors. For every 40 goblins there will be a leader and his 4 assistants, each having 1 Hit Die (7 hit points). For every 200 goblins there will be a sub-chief and 2-8 (2d4) bodyguards, each of which has 1+1 Hit Dice (8 hit points), is Armor Class 5, and armed with a battle axe. The tribe has a single goblin chief and 2-8 (2d4) bodyguards each of 2 Hit Dice, Armor Class 4, and armed with two weapons.
    There is a 25% chance that 10% of their force will be mounted upon huge worgs, and have another 10-40 (1d4Ã—10) unmounted worgs with them. There is a 60% chance that the lair is guarded by 5-30 (5d6) such wolves, and a 20% chance of 2-12 (2d6) bugbears . Goblin shamans are rare, but have been known to reach 7th level. Their spheres include: Divination, Healing (reversed), Protection, and Sun (reversed). In addition to the males, there will be adult females equal to 60% of their number and children equal to the total number of adults in the lair. Neither will fight in battles.
    A goblin tribe has an exact pecking order; each member knows who is above him and who is below him. They fight amongst themselves constantly to move up this social ladder.
    They often take slaves for both food and labor. The tribe will have slaves of several races numbering 10-40% of the size of the tribe. Slaves are always kept shackled, and are staked to a common chain when sleeping.
    Goblins hate most other humanoids, gnomes and dwarves in particular, and work to exterminate them whenever possible.
  Ecology: |
    Goblins live only 50 years or so. They do not need to eat much, but will kill just for the pleasure of it. They eat any creature from rats and snakes to humans. In lean times they will eat carrion.
    Goblins usually spoil their habitat, driving game from it and depleting the area of all resources. They are decent miners, able to note new or unusual construction in an underground area 25% of the time, and any habitat will soon be expanded by a maze-like network of tunnels.

  Description: |
    Though wildspace is fraught with mind-blasting perils, it also holds great beauty. The musical, pacifistic race known as the Gonnlingdaah (or the Gonn for short) brings much beauty to wildspace. These good beings float through wildspace creating hauntingly beautiful music and preserving life. Though blessed with brilliant intellect, they live a simple but extremely long life. Instead of speaking, they sing. The Gonn can sing in their own mysterious language and in Common.
    The Gonn resemble gas giants: perfect spheres with bands of different colors decorating their body. To the novice sailor, the Gonn appear by a trick of perspective as far-off planets.
  Combat: |
    Though the Gonn do not consider combat their first option, they wisely realize that sometimes one must fight to preserve good. Before any combat, however, the Gonn attempt to negotiate with all but the most violent, life-hating beings. The Gonn offer to help foes change their violent ways. If the opponent rejects their offer of help and peace, the Gonn bring their powers full to bear with no hesitation.
    The Gonn's power is music, and their songs can accomplish amazing feats. Their most powerful song is a high-pitched keening that affects all enemies of the Gonn's choice within 240'. All targets take 10d10 sonic damage (save vs. breath weapon at a -2 penalty for half damage). Targets that fail to save must roll saving throws for their equipment vs. crushing blow, also at a -2 penalty. Due to the enormous power of this song, the Gonn are loathe to use it except against the most destructive foes.
    Another destructive musical attack is a single shrill note. All non-living matter in 240' must save vs. disintegration or shatter. Living beings of the Gonn's choice are deafened for 1d4 rounds.
    The Gonn prefer a gentle, soothing song of pacification. All targets of the Gonn's choice must save vs. spell at a -1 penalty or immediately cease combat and relax, listening to the sweet music. In addition, 30% of victims fall asleep for 2d10 turns. Those who save are confused and can take no action for one round.
    Gonn can cause magical spells within 240' to cease functioning by singing a lilting ditty that acts as dispel magic at 9th level.
    A Gonn can sing each of these songs three times a day. Gonn prefer to sing in groups of eight, called "scales". All Gonn in a scale must sing the same song. A Gonn sings solo only if it has no other choice. Such a song is diminished in power; saves are made without penalty.
    Since Gonn music comes from their every pore, silence spells are useless against them. However, enemies in the circle of silence are immune to Gonn songs. Bard songs cannot counteract Gonn songs, since the behemoths sing so powerfully that they drown out any other sound.
  Habitat/Society: |
    In every scale, one Gonn is the leader, called the "conductor". The scale moves in formation, each Gonn singing one note.
    Gonn live for up to six millennia, wandering wildspace, collecting songs and tales. Each Gonn's name is a long song that would take 1d20 hours to sing. Among shorter-lived races they adopt shorter melodies as temporal names.
    Though the Gonn love to answer questions, the asker had best be ready for a long answer. They ramble on and on, singing instead of talking. Typically, one who seeks information from one of these singing sages must listen through 1d8 days of non-stop singing. Each day, there is a cumulative 10% chance the Gonn gives the information. The price of an answer is a song or story (make a non-weapon proficiency check to produce a successful song). Failing this, the Gonn accepts gems worth 500 gp instead.
    Besides their attack spells, Gonn can also sing the following spells: heal , restoratio , raise dead , identify , and legend lore . Costs for these spells are 1,000 gp in gems per level of the spell cast, plus a song or story. However, Gonn defend, rescue, and heal anyone that they see hurt by evil, without charge.The Gonn wander often, and like the Fal , they dislike intrusions by the same visitors more than once a year. It is practically impossible to find the same scale of Gonn one met before.
  Ecology: |
    Once a century, a scale of Gonn engages in a song of perpetuity, which takes 1d12 months and results in the birth of 2d4 immature Gonn. The young cannot sing for five years, when they reach maturity. Until then, they hum.
    The Gonn try to preserve life any way they can. Some speculate that either Oghma or Apollo created them to bring beauty to the universe.

gossamer:
  Summary:
    The gossamer is a creature from the Spelljammer campaign setting.
  Stats:
  Description: |
    Gossamers are the spacefaring cousins of the jellyfish. They travel in groups known as shoals. Gossamers usually drift among the rocks of asteroid fields and the junk of space sargassos, though they occasionally venture into open space . They scavenge leftover prey, cleaning areas of organic junk.
    Gossamer shoals offer beautiful color displays that communicate their moods. Contented gossamers are awash with waves of cool colors â€“ green, blue and purple punctuated with bright flecks of yellow and orange. When danger threatens, waves of red and amber wash over the shoal from the point of contact. These displays lead some sages to theorize a group-mind among gossamer shoals.
  Combat: |
    Like the jellyfish, the standard gossamer grows stinging tentacles. The tentacles secrete a nauseating paralytic poison. A saving throw versus poison offsets the allergic reaction. Gossamers only attack prey smaller than themselves. If the offending object is larger than 1', the shoal immediately changes direction away from the offending critter. The gossamer may accidentally collide with and sting larger creatures, or foolish crewmen may touch a dead gossamer that has landed on a ship deck.
  Ecology: |
    Most of the gossamer's body consists of empty space, and depends on weightlessness to maintain its structural integrity. If introduced to a gravity plane, the gossamer collapses under its own weight and dies. Air also renders the gossamer's body liquid. Dead gossamers collapse in 1d3 minutes into viscous pools of evil-smelling liquid. The liquid is a solution of the enzymes that cause the gossamers to sting, and remains dangerous until it evaporates (one turn).
  Gossamer Noble: |
    Actually a colony of specialized life forms, the gossamer noble is 10d10' in diameter, with enormous sacs that act as sails, allowing it to navigate at spelljamming speeds. Cloudy currents and colorful lightning-like flashes fill its pearly, translucent body.
    Hundreds of tentacles trail from the noble's base. These are long (50-500'), supple hawsers with wicked spikes that inflict 1d2 points each on exposed flesh. The gossamer noble uses 1d20 of these tentacles in battle. Victims must save at -4 vs. paralyzation, and the spikes' digestive enzymes inflict an additional 1d6 points of damage per round. These solitary predators live on spacefaring life forms (including smaller spelljamming ships) and are highly dangerous. They are the prey and natural enemy of gammaroids.

  Description: |
    Gravs are short, stocky humanoids who manipulate gravity. They mine ore and gems from unclaimed asteroids and moons . A grav is short, squat and square, with a small head in comparison to the rest of its body. Gravs are as tall as dwarves but are wider at the shoulders. Miners wear dingy gray clothes and mining gear such as helmets, gloves, and belts.
    The Elite are thinner than their worker minions but are still squat. They wear refined, foppish clothing and seldom sully their hands with manual labor. Some Elite wear leather protection under their showy clothing â€“ hence the lower Armor Class.
    All gravs are dense, with three times the mass of a being of a similar size. This increases their air envelope, allowing them more time to search wildspace for potential mining sites.
  Combat: |
    Gravs are a peaceful race, intent on their mining and leaving other races alone. If provoked, however, gravs retaliate by reducing gravity beneath a target (and thus its weight). A grav can only affect one target at a time, with a range of 60'. However, the target can contain many objects; for instance, after mining gems, the gravs move them into large crates and then float the crates aboard ship.
    The grav can reduce the target's weight by 25% per round. After four rounds, the target begins to float. The grav can make the target hover or float away. When the target floats beyond the grav's range, it plummets to the nearest gravity plane.
    The grav can just drop the target or gently lower it to the ground. If a grav's concentration is disrupted, as by a blow, the target drops immediately, taking normal falling damage.
    Gravs use this power to intimidate and scare their opponents away. If confronted, a grav first demonstrates its power on an inanimate object. If this intimidation doesnâ€™t work, the grav suspends the opponent in the air, incapacitating it.
    Though peaceful by nature, gravs hate silatics , which eat metal. Even the Elite attack silatics on sight.
  Habitat/Society: |
    In the strictly hierarchical grav society, the Elite order the Miners (workers), who obey almost without thinking. Miners who question this centuries-old structure are promptly "brought in for questioning" and "moved to a position better fitting their talents" â€“ servitude to some minor Elite on the homeworld. This is ultimate shame.
    If characters try to subvert Miners against their overseers, the Elite politely ask the characters to leave the area. If they persist, the gravs remove them without harm.
    Elite gravs can use spells and advance to 9th level. The wizards power the Argosy , the grav's standard ship.
    An Argosy resembles a small dwarven Citadel . The ship's stone surface is pitted like a moon; some craters are concealed portholes. One part is flattened, allowing it to land and take on precious cargo. (Most of the ship's interior is cargo space for ore and gems. Both Miners and their Elite overseers sleep in the cargo bays.) The Argosy's armaments are strictly for defense.
  Ecology: |
    The name and location of the grav homeworld are unknown. Conversations with Elite gravs reveal that their homeworld is divided into fiefdoms, each ruled by one Elite family. Family prestige depends on wealth.
    Some say the scarcity of information about their homeworld represents the Elite's attempt to foil potential thieves. However, thievery is totally alien to the grav race. Any thought or suggestion of stealing merely puzzles a grav. The Elite may maintain secrecy to prevent outsiders from disrupting the social system that keeps them in power.

  Description: |
    The gravislayer is a navigational hazard hated by spelljammers throughout the Known Sphere. Its unremarkable body hides one of the most destructive forces known.
    The gravislayer's body is a sphere of flesh roughly six feet in diameter, scarred and pitted from the rigors of deep space patrolling. There are no eyes, ears, or other features readily visible on its grayish surface; there is a large mouth that opens up only during feeding. A gravislayer feeds on the crushed flesh and bone of unsuspecting spacefarers that are smashed to bits by the creature's deadly command of gravity.
  Combat: |
    The gravislayer's weapon is its ability to change gravity. It can turn any single object within 150 yards into a powerful gravity source. That object may be a living being, an asteroid , or even a character. The object remains a gravity source for as long as the gravislayer concentrates.
    The gravislayer's weapon relies on two things: the availability of objects to fall onto new gravity sources and how far those objects fall before impact.
    Availability of Objects: Anything that falls for a period of time picks up great momentum and causes vast damage upon impact. A gravislayer usually turns its victims into gravity sources, hoping that asteroids will fall upon them to destroy them.
    For purposes of gravislayer combat, asteroids are divided into three categories. Pebbles are stones weighing less than one pound. Boulders weigh in the neighborhood of 100-1,000 pounds. Finally, planetoids weigh more than 10,000 pounds. Note: Every object, be it an asteroid, piece of a spaceship, or a chest of gold, should be placed into one of these categories.
    The numbers and sizes of asteroids available to a gravislayer depend upon its immediate surroundings.
    Falling Time: Each asteroid, regardless of size, takes 1d6 rounds to fall onto the target (roll for each asteroid). The damage caused depends on the asteroid size and on the number of rounds it fell. A successful saving throw vs. breath weapon negates all damage inflicted by pebbles and boulders and half damage from planetoids.
  Hit Points of Damage, By Rounds Fallen
          1    2    3    4     5     6
    Pellet    1d4  3d4  6d4  10d4  15d4  21d4
    Boulder   1d6  3d6  6d6  10d6  15d6  21d6
    Planetoid 1d12 3d12 6d12 10d12 15d12 21d12
     Hull Damage, By Rounds Fallen
          1    2    3    4    5    6
    Pellet    1d4  2d4  3d4  4d4  5d4  6d4
    Boulder   1d6  2d6  3d6  4d6  5d6  6d6
    Planetoid 1d12 2d12 3d12 4d12 5d12 6d12
    If the gravislayer is destroyed before the asteroids strike the target, those asteroids are then much easier to avoid (roll a saving throw vs. breath weapon against each, with a bonus of 5, plus 2 for every round until impact). Common tactics for ship crews is to immediately locate gravislayers and destroy them as quickly as possible, then deal with the falling asteroids.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Gravislayers have no known planet of origin or societal inclinations. Shipboard tales speak of a cult of nebulords, wizards of tremendous power, who were enemies of the reigar . The nebulords created gravislayers for their own purposes, turning them loose throughout space.
  Ecology: |
    No gravislayers have ever been captured for examination, so their means of reproduction is uncertain. They may have none. A gravislayer is immune to the gravity that it creates. It is not, however, immune to naturally occurring gravity.

  Description: |
    These enormous spacegoing cetaceans are apparently responsible for the occurrence of whales and other cetaceans, both in space and on worlds with plentiful water. They travel through space in a spherical envelope of airy water, so large that weather patterns occur on its surface, creating the image of an immense elemental whale swimming through the cosmos. Within it swims the Dreamer's "entourage": 1-3 leviathans, their attendants, and 2-12 intelligent delphinid "knights" of 9-12 HD each.
    Like the delphinid, the Great Dreamer is trilaterally symmetrical. Its three eyes, equidistant around the head, shine with reflected starlight.
    Communication with the Great Dreamers is not difficult; their broad-band telepathy makes conversation easy within a range of 1,000 miles. Their "speech" can be circular, seemingly wandering from topic to topic in a stream of consciousness, but they invariably return to the subject at hand.
  Combat: |
    The Great Dreamers do not normally engage in combat; their great power speaks for itself. The aura given off by these beings is so powerful, opponents must save vs. spell at -4 or be caught up in the beauty of the Dreamers' existence.
    Against those who do save and still have warlike intentions, a Great Dreamer can also contact the Elemental Planes of Water and Air, summoning 1d8 elementals of 12-16 HD to do its bidding. The elementals either wash or destroy an offending spelljammer; only when its entourage takes severe injury does a Dreamer order its elementals to kill an opponent.
    If nothing dissuades an attacker, then he faces the onslaught of the Dreamer's entourage.
    In addition to the listed abilities, the entourage members have a sound lance that can stun opponents within a 10-mile range. Targets must save vs. breath weapon or be stunned for 1d4 turns. The delphinids direct their sound lances against one opponent at a time. Larger whales aim at entire vessels, and can also change tones to resonate with a ship's hull, causing a ship to rattle itself to pieces (2d6 hull points of damage per round).
    If necessary, the Great Dreamer uses its magical ability to project a giant waterspout from its water envelope. The waterspout has a range of 20 miles. The ship must save vs. crushing blow or be destroyed by the rushing wall of water. Ships that save take 2d10 hull points of damage.
    A Great Dreamer's bite can inflict damage according to its Hit Dice. Dreamers of 72-83 HD inflict 3d4Ã—2 hull points, those of 84-95 HD inflict 3d4Ã—3 hull points, and those of 96-144 HD inflict 3d4Ã—4 hull points.
    If a Dreamer's attack roll is 2 more than needed to hit, it can swallow its opponent. It can either digest a victim or send him to a destination of its choice. A Dreamer's tail can deliver a crushing blow with damage equal to half its HD. (For example, a 72 HD Great Dreamer does 36d8 damage, or 36-288 hp.)
  Habitat/Society: |
    It is unknown whether the Great Dreamer generates its spherical envelope of water and air or opens a gateway to the Elemental Plane of Water. The envelope instantly responds to the Great Dreamer's commands.
    These beings remain in the flow , traveling from sphere to sphere, attending to cetacean affairs on many worlds. Every 1000 years, the leviathans of each world receive an audience with the Great Dreamers to report on the events of the previous millennium. They remain for a year before returning to their homeworlds.
  Ecology: |
    Though they feel neutral toward humanoids, the Dreamers are always lawful in alignment. They preserve the abundance of life both in the seas and in the endless ocean of the flow. They perceive existence to be a continuous song, an endless paean to life itself. All members of a Great Dreamer's entourage continuously sing this hypnotic song.
    Perhaps as a function of this guardianship of life, the Great Dreamers have one final ability: the power to grant immortality to one being, once per year. Usually the champion who receives this honor is a cetacean. Rarely, however, a humanoid who has greatly aided the Dreamers' subjects may receive this gift.

  Description: |
    Also known as Anhktepot's Children , greater mummies are a powerful form of undead created when a high-level lawful evil priest of certain religions is mummified and charged with the guarding of a burial place. It can survive for centuries as the steadfast protector of its lair, killing all who would defile its holy resting place.
    Greater mummies look just like their more common cousins save that they are almost always adorned with (un)holy symbols and wear the vestments of their religious order. They give off an odor that is said to be reminiscent of a spice cupboard because of the herbs used in the embalming process that created them.
    Greater mummies are keenly intelligent and are able to communicate just as they did in life. Further, they have an inherent ability to telepathically command all normal mummies created by them. They have the ability to control other mummies, provided that they are not under the domination of another mummy, but this is possible only when verbal orders can be given.
  Combat: |
    Greater mummies radiate an aura of fear that causes all creatures who see them to make a fear check. A modifier is applied to this fear check based on the age of the monster, as indicated on the Age &amp; Abilities table at the end of this section. The effects of failure on those who miss their checks are doubled because of the enormous power and presence of this creature. The mummy's aura can be defeated by a remove fear , cloak of bravery , or similar spell.
    In combat, greater mummies have the option of attacking with their own physical powers or with the great magic granted to them by the gods they served in life. In the former case, they may strike but once per round, inflicting 3d6 points of damage per attack.
    Anyone struck by the mummy's attack suffers the required damage and becomes infected with a horrible rotting disease that is even more sinister than that of normal mummies for it manifests itself in a matter of days, not months. The older the mummy, the faster this disease manifests itself (see the Age &amp; Ability table at the end of this entry for exact details). The disease causes the person to die within a short time unless proper medical care can be obtained. Twenty-four hours after the infecting blow lands, the character loses 1 point from his Strength and Constitution due to the effects of the virus on his body. Further, they lose 2 points of Charisma as their skin begins to flake and whither like old parchment. No normal healing is possible while the disease is spreading through the body, and the shaking and convulsions that accompany it make spell casting or memorization impossible for the character. Only one form of magical healing has any effect â€“ a regenerate spell will cure the disease and restore lost hit points, but not ability scores. All others healing spells are wasted. A series of cure disease spells (one for each day that has passed since the rotting was contracted) will temporarily halt the infection until a complete cure can be affected. Regaining lost ability score points is not possible through any means short of a wish.
    The body of a person who dies from mummy rot begins to crumble into dust as soon as death occurs. The only way to resurrect a character who dies in this way is to cast both a cure disease and a raise dead spell on the body within 6 turns (1 hour) of death. If this is not done, the body (and the spirit within it) are lost forever.
    Greater mummies can be turned by those who have the courage and conviction to attempt this feat; however, the older the mummy, the harder it is to overcome in this fashion. Once again, the details are provided on the Age &amp; Abilities Table. They are immune to damage from holy water, but contact with a holy symbol from a non-evil faith inflicts 1d6 points of damage on them. Contact with a holy symbol of their own faith actually restores 1d6 hit points.
    Perhaps the most horrible aspect of these creatures, however, is their spell casting ability. All greater mummies were priests in their past lives and now retain the spell casting abilities they had then. They will cast spells as if they were of 16th through 20th level (see below) and will have the same spheres available to them that they did in life. Greater mummies receive the same bonus spells for high Wisdom scores that player characters do. Dungeon Masters are advised to select spells for each greater mummy in an adventure before the adventure starts. For those using Legends &amp; Lore in their games, greater mummies are most often priests of Osiris , Set , and Nephythys . For those using The Complete Priest's Handbook , they are usually associated with the worship of ancestors, darkness, death, disease, evil, guardianship, and revenge. (If neither of these works is being used in the campaign, simply assign the mummy powers as if it were a standard high-level cleric.)
    Greater mummies can be harmed only by magical weapons, with older ones being harder to hit than younger ones. Even if a weapon can affect them, however, it will inflict only half damage because of the magical nature of the creature's body.
    Spells are also less effective against greater mummies than they are against other creatures. Those that rely on cold to inflict damage are useless against the mummy, while those that depend on fire inflict normal damage. Unlike normal mummies, these foul creatures are immune to non-magical fire. The enchanting process that creates them, however, leaves them vulnerable to attacks involving electricity; all spells of that nature inflict half again their normal damage. In addition, older mummies develop a magic resistance that makes even those spells unreliable.
    Greater mummies, like vampires , become more powerful with the passing of time in Ravenloft . The following table lists the applicable changes to the listed statistics (which are for a newly created monster) brought on by the passing of time:
    Notes:
    To Hit indicates the magical plus that must be associated with a weapon before it will inflict damage to the mummy.
    AC is the Armor Class of the monster.
    HD are the number of hit dice that the mummy has. Greater mummies are turned as if they had one more Hit Die than they actually do, so a 250 year old (10+3) is turned as if it had 11 Hit Dice. Any mummy 300 years old or older is turned as a "special" undead.
    THAC0 is listed for the various Hit Dice levels of the mummy to allow for easy reference during play.
    Alignment As the mummy grows older, it becomes darker and more evil. In cases where two alignments are listed, there is a 75% chance that the mummy will be of the first alignment and a 25% chance that it will be of the second. Thus, a 300 year old mummy is 75% likely to be chaotic evil.
    Wisdom is the creature's Wisdom score. When employing their spells, greater mummies receive all of the bonus spells normally associated with a high Wisdom. Further, as they pass into the higher ratings (19 and beyond) they gain an immunity to certain magical spells as listed in the Player's Handbook.
    Magic is the creature's natural magic resistance. As can be seen from the table, old mummies can be very deadly indeed.
    Disease is the length of time it takes for a person infected with the mummy's rotting disease to die.
    Level indicates the creature's level as a priest. Older mummies have access to far greater magics than younger ones and are thus more dangerous than younger ones.
    XP lists the number of experience points awarded to a party for battling and defeating a greater mummy of a given age.
    Mummies indicates the number of normal mummies that the creature will have serving it when encountered.
    Fear indicates the penalty to those making fear checks due to the evil influence of the greater mummy's foul aura.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Greater mummies are powerful undead creatures that are usually created from the mummified remains of powerful, evil priests. This being the case, the greater mummy now draws its mystical abilities from evil powers and darkness. In rare cases, however, the mummified priests served non-evil god in life and are still granted the powers they had in life from those gods.
    Greater mummies often dwell in large temple complexes or tombs where they guard the bodies of the dead from the disturbances of grave robbers. Unlike normal mummies, however, they have been known to leave their tombs and strike out into the world -- bringing a dreadful shroud of evil down upon every land they touch.
    When a greater mummy wishes to create normal mummies as servants, it does so by mummifying persons infected with its rotting disease. This magical process requires 12-18 hours (10+2d4) and cannot be disturbed without ruining the enchantment. Persons to be mummified are normally held or charmed so that they cannot resist the mummification process. Once the process is completed, victims are helpless to escape the bandages that bind them. If nothing happens to free them, they will die of the mummy rot just as they would have elsewhere. Upon their death, however, a strange transformation takes place. Rather than crumbling away into dust, these poor souls rise again as normal mummies. Obviously, this process is too time consuming to be used in actual combat, but the greater mummy will often attack a potential target in hopes of capturing and transforming it into a mummy. All mummies created by a greater mummy are under its telepathic command.
  Ecology: |
    The first of these creatures is known to have been produced by Anhktepot , the Lord of Har'akir , in the years before he became undead himself. It is believed that most, if not all, of the greater mummies he created in his life were either destroyed or drawn into Ravenloft with him when he was granted a domain. A number of these creatures are believed to serve Anhktepot in his domain, acting as his agents in other lands he wishes to learn what is transpiring in other portions of Ravenloft.
    The process by which a greater mummy is created remains a mystery to all but Anhktepot. It is rumored that this process involves a great sacrifice to gain the favor of the gods and an oath of eternal loyalty to the Lord of Har'akir. If the latter is true, then it may lend credence to the claim of many sages that Anhktepot can command every greater mummy in existence to do his bidding. If this is indeed the case, it makes the power of this dark fiend far greater than is generally supposed.

  Description: |
    Greatswans are massive swans raised and trained by elves to act as guards and war mounts. Like normal groundling swans, greatswans are ferocious fighters, and many have a nasty temper.
    As a rule, greatswans are found with any race of elves in wildspace . Greatswans sometimes ride aboard elven men-o-war (25% chance) and armadas (50%). Normally, there are 2d6 greatswans on the former and 4d6 on the latter. Each vessel also has a like number of elven swanrider cavalry. A greatswan can carry up to two elf-sized riders (the equivalent of about 240 pounds).
    Greatswans are beautiful, graceful birds with characteristic long necks and snow-white plumage. The swans have no language.
    Like their mundane counterparts, greatswan males are called "cobs", and the females are called "pens". Young greatswans are called "cygnets".
  Combat: |
    Though greatswans are gentle birds, they nevertheless fight with a strong strike of their beak (1d6 damage) and wing buffeting (2d6 damage). The wing buffet has a 50% chance of blinding and confusing the opponent for one round. There is a 25% chance that the sheer force of the wings knocks a man-sized or smaller foe backwards 2d10 feet.
    If a greatswan is used as a mount, it cannot perform the wing buffet while in flight. However, an elven swanrider can urge his mount into what amounts to a power dive against an enemy; the elf's weapon and the greatswan's beak each gain a +2 bonus to THAC0 and do double damage. Elves use mostly medium lances for such attacks.
    Greatswans have excellent senses, and have a 75% chance of detecting an intruder, even an invisible one. This makes them well suited for guard duties. Swans that spot an intruder raise a raucous call and close with the enemy, wings flailing madly.
    Greatswans are immune to all forms of poison.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Greatswans wander exclusively in elves' lands. The elves fear that introducing such large birds to normal environments may alter the balance of nature. Thus they keep the birds close at hand and watch their movements closely.
    Greatswans are aquatic birds, and are excellent swimmers. This comes in handy when the elves are exploring water worlds in wildspace.
    Unlike groundling swans, greatswans are not territorial. They become hostile only if intruders approach within 30' of either their nests or guardposts. Greatswans recognize the names their trainers give them and can learn command phrases, one command per point of Intelligence.
    Greatswans are bred to require little air. A lungful of air lasts the bird 24 hours. A greatswan's personal gravity drags along enough air for two elf-sized riders to breathe for 5d10 turns.
    Elves found with greatswans have the Airborne Riding nonweapon proficiency. Such elves are always at least 3rd-level fighters, armed with some sort of charging weapon (such as a spear, pike, lance) and a bow (long or short) in addition to their normal melee weapon. A greatswan never carries any rider but an elf. Encountered without elves in attendance, an even number of greatswans are mated pairs. There are 1d2 cygnets and 1d4 eggs per pair.
  Ecology: |
    As mentioned earlier, the elves confine the greatswans to their own sylvan lands and cities, fearful that the birds' large appetites will upset the balance of nature. Greatswans eat green plants, especially water plants, and they eat large numbers of insects, digesting even the most poisonous insect without harm. Greatswans consider feesu , space moths, a delicacy. Elves use feesu as a reward during a cygnetâ€™s training.
    Some elven mages use greatswan feathers to create Quaal's feather tokens , wings of flying , and winged boots.

  Description: |
    Grommams are gorilla-like apes with heavy upper-body musculature. Their legs are short and their feet are roughly soled and their toes have a limited ability to grasp objects. Grommams have short, rough, copper-red fur all over their bodies except on their faces, the palms of their hands, and the soles of their feet. Their skin is a rich chocolate brown. Most grommams are five feet tall and have arm spans up to nine feet wide. Males weigh 350-500 lbs., while females weigh half as much.
    Grommams use a gestural and finger-sign language. Body postures, facial expressions, and a variety of vocal hoots, screams, grunts, and calls add to the basic language, called "grommish" by other races.
    Grommams prefer to wear loose, brightly colored clothing, particularly short-sleeved kimonos. They are fond of belts, arm straps, and leg straps, to which they attach weapons and tools that are tied down.
  Combat: |
    Grommams prefer to use weapons when attacking, though some enjoy wrestling and similar martial arts. Almost any melee weapon that a huma can use can also be used by a grommam without change. Chain mail is used almost exclusively for its light weight and flexibility. Shields can be used, but most grommams take advantage of their ambidexterity and use a weapon in either hand.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Grommams are a close-knit people. Grommams make their home in forests, but they enjoy the same sorts of climates as humans. They climb extremely well and some build treehouses, but most grommams are ground dwellers. A grommam family usually consists of one adult male, 1-2 adult females, and 1d4 children. One female generally cooks, cleans, and manages the children, while the other directs all household affairs such as finances, purchases, and dealings with other grommam families. The male performs heavy labor either for the family or for a local guild or business. Several dozen related families form a clan, the basic social unit, and 2d4 clans form a house, which is led by a demigod (see below). In most clans, only the "director" female is allowed to vote on political issues. Unmarried males form the backbone of the military forces, and more than a few become adventurers.
    Like other races, grommams have gods â€“ but their gods (of demigod level) openly live among the grommams themselves as their rulers and advisors. (Typical statistics for a demigod: AC 2; MV 12 (15 in trees); F15/T15/C12; hp 100; THAC0 5: #AT 1 or 2; Dmg by spell or weapon type; abilities near maximum levels; ML 18; AL LG.) These statistics vary widely by sex and among individuals. Grommams are highly religious and organized, and most are lawful good.
    Though most adult grommams have a standard 2+1 Hit Dice, one in eight is able to adopt a character class. A fairly young race, grammars have limited options. Males may become fighters or thieves (up to 20th level), and both sexes may become clerics (up to 10th level); they cannot be multiclassed. All grommams can climb walls at 85%, +1% per class level to 99%. Being very antimagical, grommams have a 40% chance for magical-item malfunction, as per dwarves (2nd Edition Player's Handbook , page 21). Their characteristics are generated as for humans, though with modifications: Males have Strengths of 2d4+10 (18/00 maximum) and suffer a -2 penalty to all rolls for Intelligence and Wisdom; females have Strengths of 2d6+4 and gain a +2 bonus to all rolls for Intelligence and Wisdom (18 maximum). All grommams have their Charisma scores lowered by two when dealing with any races but their own and other ape-like species.
    Grommam spelljammer ships (usually purchased from humans) are altered to appear powerful and dramatic, with bright colors and wild designs, but they work just like any other ships. Because grommams are so adept at climbing, they make heavy use of ropes, riggings, and swing bars.
  Ecology: |
    Grommams are omnivorous, eating almost any sort of fruits, vegetables, nuts, roots, and small game animals. They have no trouble eating the food of any human or demihuman race. Grommams have little effect on the affairs of other races.

  Description: |
    Gullions are related to terrestrial seagulls but have adapted to life in space . Spelljamming crews despise them, because they waste precious air and demand a good deal of food.
    Due to exposure to many different magics and climes, the gullions vary widely in color, from purple to orange to normal gull colorings, but all are shaped like large seagulls.
  Combat: |
    Gullions try to steal food. For birds with animal intelligence, they are incredibly sneaky; they sometimes stage diversions in order to get their beaks on someone's dinner.
    Gullions only attack in numbers and only when extremely hungry. If a large group of gulls haven't eaten in days, they attack the nearest food â€“ usually crew members on a ship. They flock together and attack with their beaks, trying to knock foes unconscious. Once a crew member has been knocked out, the gullions search for food on the body. If there isn't enough food to satisfy them, they start eating the victim.
    Many green crews plagued with gullions try to kill as many as possible as soon as they enter wildspace. This is difficult, for the gulls have adapted to the air envelope around ships and use the gravity line to fly erratically. This gives them a low Armor Class. More experienced crews tolerate the colorful birds, and usually cast food out into the air envelope to keep the scavengers satisfied.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Gullions can survive in almost any environment. They hitch rides with ships from one world to another. The gulls stay in the travelling ship's air envelope, as they have no spelljamming ability. These gulls have also grown accustomed to the gravity plane and actually sleep while floating along the plane.
    Upon landfall, gullions jump spelljammers and may inhabit port towns their whole lives. Planet-bound natives often wonder how these colorful gulls suddenly appeared.
  Ecology: |
    As scavengers, gullions aren't picky about what they eat: Rats, garbage, and leftovers all form part of their diet. Some innkeepers encourage gullions to stay around, primarily to eat the remains of last night's dinners.
    Nesting areas for flocks of gullions with exceptionally bright colors can become tourist attractions. This can lead to nasty infighting between bar owners about which establishment owns a particular flock. The gullions don't care, as long as they get fed.

  Description: |
    Called "deck apes", hadozee are indeed ape-like. Rough taller and more slander than the typical ape, hadozee have brown hair covering their bodies. With a shaggy mane surrounding all of the head except for the face. The mouth is a protruding muzzle with several long fangs.
    The most unusual feature of a hadozee is the membrane of skin that normally hangs loosely from the creature's arms and legs. When a hadozee raises its hands over its head, this membrane is stretched taut and the creature has a limited gliding ability, as explained below.
    Hadozee are very nimble. They can climb trees, ropes, poles, and sheer surfaces as 10th-level thieves. Their feet are fully as dexterous as their hands, even to the extent of having opposable thumbs. Hadozee are tailless.
    Hadozee are often hired as mercenary crews by spacefaring races, though they have no space travel capabilities of their own. Also, the race has a well-known capability for hard work, so they are most commonly encountered as hired crewmen on the vessels of others. They are especially popular with elves , both as crewmen and hired warriors.
  Combat: |
    Hadozee are born warriors, thoroughly at home in melee combat. They can use all weapons that humans can. Indeed, hadozee can wield a weapon in each hand â€“ or in a hand and a foot â€“ without penalty for two-handed combat. Their preferred weapons include long swords, spears, and halberds.
    A hadozee can glide through the air by spreading the membranes on its wings, traveling one foot forward for every foot of height it loses.
    In addition, hadozee have learned to exploit the gravity plane in their attacks against space vessels. Hadozee dive toward the enemy deck or hull, seeking a place to land and wield their weapons. If no place presents itself, they dive past the vessel and through the gravity plane. They then soar up a distance equal to three-quarters that from which they originally descended, and can maneuver around to dive back at the vessel from the other side of the gravity plane.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Hadozee of both sexes are eager to be accepted into the companies of sailors and mercenaries that sail among the stars. A group of young adults trains together, forming a company of up to 20 or 30 individuals. They then seek work for the master of a spacefaring vessel. The highest honor for a hadozee is to hire on as crew or warrior for elves.
    Only when they grow too old for the life of activity and adventure do hadozee return to a world, where they mate and raise the next generation.
    The hadozee relationship with elves goes back to the time of the Unhuman Wars , when the deck apes first showed a level of conscience and culture greater than the orcs and their kin, with which they had previously been grouped. The hadozee aided the elves in that war, and they have bee allied ever since. The elves have willingly employed the talents of the hadozee, and have in return paid them well. The elves in no way consider the hadozee to be an equal race, however.
  Ecology: |
    Hadozee have the same sustenance and protection needs as humans. Their diets are a little more adaptable â€“ they will eat grubs and insects, for example â€“ and they like their climate warm to tropical. But they can dress for cold weather and eat human food without complaining.

  Description: |
    When adventuring companies journey into the wilderness they often run into ogres; big, ugly humanoids. Occasionally, an ogre party will include one or two individuals that are a little shorter, but significantly smarter, wielding a weapon with more skill than might have been expected. They have a better understanding of their opponents, and they grunt commands that anticipate the adventurers' moves. In this way half-breeds, the issue of ogres and humans , earn the respect of their kind.
    Half-ogres range from 7 to 8 feet in height and weigh from 315 to 425 pounds. Skin and hair color are variable, but tend toward brown, gray, black, dull yellow (skin only), or any of the above with a slight gray-green tint. Teeth and nails are always orange. Most half-ogres have human-like eyes, though about one in five have the white pupils common to ogres. Their odor is noticeable, but it is not as overpowering as that of a full-blooded ogre. The half-ogre traditionally wears heavy skins and furs, bringing his Armor Class up to that of his ogre brethren, but rare individuals have the ability to make a shirt of chain-mail, for an AC of 3. Half-ogres speak common (more clearly and unimpeded than ogres), ogrish, orcish , troll , and one other, usually human, language. They live about 110 years.
    Half-ogres posses infravision out to 60 feet. Their sense of smell is better than an ogre's, but it falls short of a human's.
  Combat: |
    Half-ogres of any sort suffer -2 penalties to their attack rolls against dwarves and -4 against gnomes , since those smaller races are so skilled at battling bigger folk.
    Half-ogres in combat are often found with full-blooded ogres. If so, the half-ogre will most likely be leading the ogre party. The ogres fight more wisely when led by a half-ogre that concentrates assaults on characters it recognizes as spellcasters, and teaming up against skilled fighters. Ambushes are better-planned and more carefully baited.
    To earn command privileges, particularly when ogre leaders are present, a half-ogre must show himself quick to battle and fierce in combat. Half-ogres' usual weapon of choice is a huge sword (use the statistics for a two-handed bastard sword, save that half-ogres can employ it one-handed, with a large shield in the other), or a war spear capable of causing 2d4 points of damage. A half-ogre inflicts an additional 2 points of damage, due to his mass.
    Half-ogres sometimes gather together to form their own tribes. In this case, they will be encountered in bands of 2d10 and will expend as much energy choosing and preparing an ambush as on the combat itself.
    For every five half-ogres in an encounter, there is an additional veteran with 5+3 Hit Dice. For every 10 half-ogres, there is a leader with 6 Hit Dice. If more than 15 half-ogres are encountered, they will have a shaman, a fighter/priest with 5+3 Hit Dice and the spells of a 4th-level priest, and two acolyte shamans, with 4+6 Hit Dice and the spells of a 2nd-level priest.
    Half-ogres are inclined to intimidate others. A broad, fang-filled smile and perhaps a slamming fist, often encourages an NPC to suddenly remember appointments, or perhaps faint dead away. Kobolds will clutch their spears and cringe in unison when 7'6" of solid muscle smashes their door to splinters and storms in; even larger monsters have serious reservations about attacking half-ogres. They will also terrify local human populations into leaving a half-ogre and his companions alone.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Half-ogres have no society of their own. If they live with ogres, they are the quick-thinking members of the tribe, ever on their toes to prove themselves worthy. If a half-ogre is reared in a human community, he learns to live with suspicion and fear, and often turns to a military or solitary occupation.
    Occasionally, half-ogres join with half-orcs , orogs , ogrillons, and other humanoids. These communities are small (5-200 residents) and usually isolated, but can appear in virtually any terrain. Half-ogres fill a middle niche â€“ more powerful than half-orcs or orogs, but smarter than ogrillons, trolls, and other humanoids. As a whole, these communities are chaotic evil, with neutral tendencies stemming from the level of cooperation necessary in a "half-caste" situation. They prefer others of their own kind, and are tolerant of orcs and ogres. Enough of them have human blood that they regard humans with neutrality.
    Indeed, chaotic evil humans often find their most enthusiastic followers in such a hybrid tribe. They also tolerate monstrous humanoids such as trolls and giants, but all other races are treated with undisguised hostility.
    Hybrid settlements raid civilized territories for prisoners and loot. A settlement may be found holding prisoners. It is also likely for treasure to be found in a hybrid camp. Half-ogres are usually cheated out of most of their rightful treasure shares by the more cunning orogs and half-orcs.
  Ecology: |
    Sages have expressed much concern over the years, wondering why ogres can interbreed with humans but not with elves or halflings . When the actual answer was discovered, the sages' concerns proved unfounded. The explanation had nothing to do with any supposed common origin of humans and ogres, but rather in a unusual characteristic that ogres share with orcs: rapidly adaptive biology. Just as orcs and ogres can adapt quickly to any terrain, from forests to the highest mountains, their genetic construction allows them breed with any humanoid race.
    This ability to breed easily is frequently passed on to their progeny. Half-ogres can also breed successfully with most other humanoid races. If this process continues for many generations, the result is a horrible hybrid known as a mongrelman. Many mongrelmen have strong strains of orc and ogre in their bloodlines, which may account for their chaotic evil attitudes.
    The half-ogre shares the ogre's place in the ecosystem: that of a plague upon demihumans and humans, lusting for treasure and making neither crafts nor good labor. The beginnings of half-ogre poetry have been around for many years, but it is exceptionally ugly and disturbing.
  Ogrillo: |
    The ogrillon is a fiercer species of the half-ogre, being the fruit of a union between ogres and orcs. The ogrillon displays the general tendencies of its larger cousin with some exceptions. It is even more brutish and violent, and it normally learns to speak only ogrish and a handful of words in common.
    The ogrillon is the size of an orc, and closely resembles one. One in every ten is born with features and coloration very similar to those of ogres: purple eyes with white pupils, black teeth, yellowish skin with dull, dark green hair. The skin of an ogrillon of either type is covered with small horn plates, giving it a superior Armor Class and enabling it to fight without weapons. An ogrillon disdains armor and most other material items, retaining only a handful of gold pieces as treasured belongings. It is uncertain why they would keep gold, except perhaps as good luck charms.
    They love mayhem. In combat they disdain weapons and plunge in with both fists. Due to their great strength and horn-reinforced fists, each punch delivers 1d6+1 points of damage. An ogrillon out of combat is restless and troubled, but it will be seen chuckling merrily to itself during a good fight.
    Because of their single-mindedness, ogrillons are often approached by orcs when they need good fighters against some enemy. Ogrillons are happy to join and fight, sometimes for the love of combat and destruction, but often for more lucky gold pieces. In combat, there is only a 10% chance that a typical ogrillon can be distinguished from an orc. Ogrillons that resemble ogres, of course, clearly stand out.
    Ogrillons are the issue of a female orc mated with a male ogre. Thankfully, it is sterile. The union of a male orc and a female ogre yields an orog, a better class of humanoid monster detailed in the Orc entry.

  Description: |
    These creatures are born on the elemental plane of Fire, formed from the union of the soul of a deceased follower of the fire elemental gods and the extreme heat of the plane. Helians are highly sentient creatures, but they do not retain the personal experiences of their former lives. They retain the intellect, the knowledge, and the wisdom gained throughout their lives, but they would not recognize friends, enemies, or even their spouses or immediate family members.
    These creatures are made completely of living flame. They possess a quasi-metallic bone structure which the flames of their bodies cling to. Helians do have definite form, their eyes and facial features being clearly visible. In fact, their skin appears to be elastic and smooth, even though it is made completely of semi-liquid flame. There is definition in the creature's musculature which makes it appear as though a helian were a very buff humanoid with reddish-yellow skin.
  Combat: |
    Helians have several different attack modes. The first type of attack is a strike with the fists, inflicting 3d4 points of damage with each blow. If the helian is able to strike someone in metal armor of any kind, this inflicts an additional 1d4 points of damage, because the residual heat takes longer to dissipate from metal than it does with living tissue, normal cloth, or leather.
    The helian's second attack is very special and lethal. It is able to conjure a gelatinous ball of flame from the elemental plane of Fire and throw it at a target. This attack causes the same damage as a 12-die fireball , inflicting 12d4 points of damage. This ball of flame has been called "a piece of the Sun." It gained this name because the heat damage inflicted by this attack mode is much higher than that of the standard fireball.
    The helian is also known to hug an opponent to death. This attack style inflicts 3d6 points of damage every round. A normal attack roll is needed to grip the opponent, but once contact is made, the only way to escape is to slay the helian. Weapons can be used, but healing spells cannot. Touching a character in the grips of a helian causes 1d6 points of damage immediately, and this is enough to halt all healing spells from working because the caster loses concentration.
    The helian must roll to hit normally to strike its target. If it misses by 2 points or less, it still inflicts half damage. There is no saving throw for the damage inflicted by the helian, whether by its fists or by its attack with the glob of flame.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Helians tend to gather together in troops which they call tribes. They protect each other whenever they are attacked by an enemy of any sort. They do not blindly attack with no regard for return fire; they know when to back down to assure their survival. They live to fight the enemy another day.
    All of this might give the impression that helians love to fight. Nothing could be further from the truth. They attack only when they feel threatened. For example, the helians living on the Su in the center of Realmspace attack any ship that comes close to their domain, because they see what these races do to their own kind, and they witness the brutality thrown onto races that are not their own. This racism is an appalling factor that they cannot bear, so to save their tribal members, they attack these spelljamming humans before the humans ever get a chance to attack them.
    The helians that live on the Sun were the few that were able to flee from the persecution of the efreet and the other fire-dwelling creatures that inhabit the elemental plane of Fire. That they are now free beings is one reason why they hate the humans so much. They know how it feels to be persecuted.

  Description: |
    The heucuva is a undead spirit similar in appearance to a skeleto , but more dangerous and more difficult to dispel.
    The heucuva appears to be a humanoid skeleton of normal size. The bones are covered by a robe that is little more than tattered rags.
  Combat: |
    The heucuva attacks by swiping with one of its hands; the sharp finger bones are capable of tearing into wood. A victim must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or be afflicted with a disease. The victim suffers a daily loss of 1 point each of Strength and Constitution. A cure disease spell must be cast on the victim to prevent death and restore the lost points.
    Heucuva are treated as wights on the Turning Undead table. They are resistant to all mind-influencing spells. Heucuva bones soon crumble once the monsters are destroyed.
    Heucuva have a special hatred of priests. Once a priest uses his spells or tries to turn the heucuva, they will concentrate on attacking that priest. They may even ignore everyone else except for the priest and those defending him.
    Heucuva are able to polymorph themselves up to three times a day. They may use this power to assume a nonthreatening shape in order to get close to an unsuspecting victim or avoid an undesired encounter when pursuing a specific prey. Heucuva may assume the form of people they have met in the recent past, such as a past victim or a member of the party that encounters the monsters. If the heucuva are in their lairs, they may assume their old (living) appearances. Groups encountered on the surface may appear to be pilgrims in procession. Such disguises fool only those who view the world solely via visible light; heucuva appear the same as other skeletal undead if looked at with infravision. The heucuva are incapable of speech; they can only moan or wail.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Heucuva roam the dark places of the world. They can be found in subterranean realms, as well as most temperate or tropical regions. Cold seems to prevent heucuvan activity, for they are not found in high, desolate mountains or in any cold regions.
    Legends tell that heucuva are the restless spirits of monastic priests who were less than faithful to their holy vows. In punishment for their heresies, they are forced to roam the dark. Their spirits, appearance, and holy powers have become perverted mockeries of their old selves. The tatters they wear are the unrecognizable remains of their monks' robes. Instead of healing, they can kill with a diseased touch. Instead of helping others, they seek to kill all who still live. Even their old power to turn undead is now used to help them resist the efforts of others to turn them.
    Heucuva retain dim memories of their old lives. Their lairs are decorated as grotesque mockeries of their old abbeys and temples. The corpses of past victims may be used to represent parishioners. These corpses may retain their original possessions, which may represent a large portion of the heucuvan treasure trove. Other accumulated treasures may be scattered around the mock altar as decorations or offerings. Such a mock temple is a chilling sight to most and an abomination that few good-aligned clerics can resist destroying.
    Some heucuva are nomadic and constantly wander on a pilgrimage to nowhere. Even these are mockeries of real pilgrimages.
  Ecology: |
    Heucuva are malignant spirits that seek to destroy those who still live. They are used as examples to remind priests the fate that befalls those who stray from their devotion or use their religion as a mask to hide unpious deeds. Powdered heucuva bones may be used in the preparation of magical items intended to corrupt the spirits of living beings or to control undead.

  Description: |
    Hobgoblins are a fierce humanoid race that wage a perpetual war with the other humanoid races. They are intelligent, organized, and aggressive.
    The typical hobgoblin is a burly humanoid standing 6Â½' tall. Their hairy hides range from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. Their faces show dark red or red-orange skin. Large males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblin eyes are either yellowish or dark brown while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often bold, blood red. Any leather is always tinted black. Hobgoblin weaponry is kept polished and repaired.
    Hobgoblins have their own language and often speak with orcs , goblins , and carnivorous apes. Roughly 20% of them can speak the common tongue of ma.
  Combat: |
    Hobgoblins in a typical force will be equipped with polearms (30%), morningstars (20%), swords and bows (20%), spears (10%), swords and spears (10%), swords and morning stars (5%), or swords and whips (5%).
    Hobgoblins fight equally well in bright light or virtual darkness, having infravision with a range of 60 feet.
    Hobgoblins hate elves and always attack them first.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Hobgoblins are nightmarish mockeries of the humanoid races who have a military society organized in tribal bands. Each tribe is intensely jealous of its status. Chance meetings with other tribes will result in verbal abuse (85%) or open fighting (15%). Hobgoblin tribes are found in almost any climate or subterranean realm.
    A typical tribe of hobgoblins will have between 20 and 200 (2d10Ã—10) adult male warriors. In addition, for every 20 male hobgoblins there will be a leader (known as a sergeant) and two assistants. These have 9 hit points each but still fight as 1+1 Hit Die monsters. Groups numbering over 100 are led by a sub-chief who has 16 hit points and an Armor Class of 3. The great strength of a sub-chief gives it a +2 on its damage rolls and allows it to fight as a 3 Hit Die monster. If the hobgoblins are encountered in their lair, they will be led by a chief with AC 2, 22 hit points, and +3 points of damage per attack, who fights as a 4 Hit Die monster. The chief has 5-20 (5d4) sub-chiefs acting as bodyguards. Leaders and chiefs always carry two weapons.
    Each tribe has a distinctive battle standard which is carried into combat to inspire the troops. If the tribal chief is leading the battle, he will carry the standard with him, otherwise it will be held by one of his sub-chiefs.
    In addition to the warriors present in a hobgoblin tribe, there will be half again that many females and three times as many children as adult males.
    Fully 80% of all known hobgoblin lairs are subterranean complexes. The remaining 20% are surface villages which are fortified with a ditch, fence, 2 gates, and 3-6 guard towers. Villages are often built upon ruined humanoid settlements and may incorporate defensive features already present in the ruins.
    Hobgoblin villages possess artillery in the form of 2 heavy catapults , 2 light catapults, and a ballista for each 50 warriors. Underground complexes may be guarded by 2-12 carnivorous apes (60%).
    They are highly adept at mining and can detect new construction, sloping passages, and shifting walls 40% of the time.
  Ecology: |
    Hobgoblins feel superior to goblins or orcs and may act as leaders for them. In such cases, the "lesser races" are used as battle fodder. Hobgoblin mercenaries may work for powerful or rich evil humanoids.
  Koalinth: |
    This marine species of hobgoblin is similar to the land dwelling variety in many respects. Koalinth dwell in shallow fresh or salt water and make their homes in caves.
    Their bodies have adapted to marine environments via the evolution of gills. Their webbed fingers and toes give them a movement rate of 12 when swimming. Their bodies are sleeker than those of hobgoblins and they have light green skin. They speak an unusual dialect of the hobgoblin tongue.
    They tend to employ thrusting weapons like spears and pole arms. Koalinth are every bit as disagreeable as hobgoblins, preying on every thing they come across, especially aquatic humanoid and demi-human races. They detest aquatic elves.

  Description: |
    Horgs are strange sentient lifeforms perfectly adapted for life in the asteroid belt of the Grinder . At a distance, they look like winged humanoids, standing about 7' tall. Their long, membranous wings, with a maximum span of about 12', replace their arms; each is tipped with a single, scimitar-like claw more than a foot long and scalpel-sharp. Their torsos are longer than a huma 's, while their muscular legs, tipped with three-taloned feet, are shorter.
    On closer inspection, they have obviously evolved along lines very different from humanoids. They have seven eyes, arranged in a ring around their heads. These eyes are a pus-like yellow-white with no discernible pupils. Because of the arrangement of the eyes, it is impossible to sneak up on a horg's blind side. Although the rest of the body is bilaterally symmetrical, the bulbous head is asymmetrical, with no obvious analogues of ears or nostrils. The creature has a circular, tooth-filled mouth that opens like the iris of a camera, positioned on the top of its head. Its back is flexible enough that it can lash forward with its upper body and bite a creature standing in front of it or behind it.
    They are unrelieved black in color, with a dry, dusty texture. They have no hair or scales, just dry, flexible skin. Vital areas of their bodies - their chests, backs, and groins - are protected by built-up layers of skin, almost like rock-hard calluses. They have no evident or overt genitalia.
    Horgs can walk clumsily on their hind legs. They are much more comfortable in the air, or flying through the vacuum of wildspace . When they fly, they beat their wings like a bat - even in space, where there is no air for their wings to act upon. They are highly maneuverable. The positioning of their mouth indicates that they evolved to feed on the wing, when their mouth will be pointing forward. Presumably there is some organ in the horg body that allows them to "fly" in a vacuum. For reasons discussed later, this organ has never been investigated.
    Horgs have no spoken language. In fact, they seem to have no sound-producing organs at all. The only sound they ever make is the dry rustling of their wing membranes when they fly.
  Combat: |
    Horgs are born warriors. Even a newborn horg can shred any but the best human fighter. They attack by biting and clawing with the long, curved talons on their wingtips. Although the claws on their feet look threatening, they never seem to use them in combat. The creatures secrete a highly corrosive, poisonous liquid from their teeth and from pores at the tips of their wing talons. Any creature wounded by either teeth or claw suffers the toxic effects of this liquid. Each round after the successful hit, the victim suffers 2d10 points of damage (save vs. poison for half damage). This damage continues for 10 rounds, or until the victim dies. Note that this damage is cumulative from attack to attack.
    What makes the creatures even more lethal is their ability to phase in and out of the Prime Material Plane like phase spiders. They can phase in, attack, and phase out, all in a single round. This gives them a -3 modifier on initiative roll. If the horgs win the initiative roll by more than 4 points, they attack and phase out before their opponents get a chance to strike back. Also, horgs frequently phase in behind their opponents so they get the +4 modifier for attacking from behind. On the Ethereal Plane, horgs get only a -1 modifier to initiative and can be attacked every round, regardless of initiative result. Although horgs can flee to the Ethereal Plane when outmatched, they rarely do so.
    Horgs seem to have an innate understanding of small-unit tactics. Even though they never seem to communicate with one another, they always coordinate their actions perfectly. They never seem to attack a group too powerful for them to overcome. If they misjudge the situation, however, and thereby suffer some unpredictable setback or see their foes reinforced, they rarely retreat from combat. It is almost as if conceding the combat to their foes is unacceptable in their eyes - even more unacceptable than death from combat.
    When a horg is killed, its body immediately phases out and vanishes from the Prime Material Plane. (This is why so little is known about horg physiology - no corpse has ever been available for study.) Normally, when a horg phases out it can be pursued by someone with access to the Ethereal Plane. On the creature's death, however, it phases to another plane - not the Ethereal Plane. Nobody has been able to determine what plane this is. (This final phase-out has led some sages to suspect that horgs are not native to the Prime Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane, and that, on death, their bodies return to their plane of origin.)
    No horg has ever been captured. Normal attempts at confinement do not work because the creatures can phase out and escape on the Ethereal Plane. If a horg is somehow successfully confined, however, it invariably commits suicide by apparently just willing itself to die - and its body phases out and vanishes.
    Horgs are totally resistant to mind-altering magics of all kinds. They are highly resistant to cold-based and electricity-based spells, receiving a +3 bonus to their saving throws against these attacks. Even though there is some suspicion they are extra-planar creatures, they are unaffected by (un)holy words and other banishing magics.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Effectively nothing is known about the society or habitat of horgs. They have never been observed except when they choose to attack a ship or asteroid settlement. Nobody knows where they leave between such attacks. Perhaps they dwell on the Ethereal Plane or some other, or within one of the asteroids of the Grinder, but these are just guesses.
    Horgs do not seem to be sexually differentiated. This could mean several things. Perhaps the race has no sexual differentiation (raising questions about just what their reproductive cycle is like); or perhaps the difference between the sexes, whether two or more, is simply not obvious to the casual observer; or perhaps only one sex participates in their attacks. No immature horg has ever been spotted.
    No horg has ever been seen to use a tool or weapon. This could be by choice, or because the creatures, although evidently intelligent, have no tendency to create or use tools.
    The preceding paragraphs describe what is not known about horgs. What is known is all too little. They are highly aggressive, attacking without provocation or warning. Attempts to correlate the frequency of attacks with a particular region of space, or perhaps with proximity to a particular asteroid, have all failed. No spacefaring race has ever escaped the predations of the horgs. While all races hate and fear them, the neogi hate them the most - probably because the horgs are even more evil and rapacious than they are!
  Ecology: |
    Nobody knows what horgs eat, or even if they eat at all. When they kill foes in combat, they do not eat the bodies nor carry the corpses off with them. If they have any natural enemies that prey upon them, these enemies have never been detected. With the current level of knowledge, it appears that horgs lie outside the normal food chain and ecology of Greyspace.

illithid:
  Summary:
    The illithid , also known as a mind flayer or mindflayer , is a hostile, spacefaring humanoid creature. Illithids are infamous for their grotesque eating habits, which involve grabbing prey with their tentacles, then tearing the prey's brains out to eat. Nowadays, however, they have created a sapient race called the oortlings to feed off. Cruel and sadistic, they often trade slaves.

  Description: |
    The illithid, or mind flayer, is an evil and feared creature of the Underdark; its powers are formidable and it feeds on the brains of any creature it encounters. Using arcane powers, it enslaves or destroys its foes, which include such powerful creatures as drow and kuo-toa.
    Mind flayers stand about 6 feet tall and have hideous mauve skin that glistens with slime. The head resembles an octopus, with white eyes (no pupils are evident) and four tentacles around its mouth, a round, many-toothed orifice like that of a lamprey. The creature has three reddish fingers and a thumb on each hand.
    Illithids have infravision. They can communicate with any creatures via innate telepathy; they have no spoken language, although they often accompany their thoughts with hissing, and the eager lashing of their tentacles. Mind flayers dress in flowing robes, often with high, stiff collars, adorned with symbols of death and despair.
  Combat: |
    A mind flayer's preferred method of attack is the mind blast, projected in a cone 60 feet long, 5 feet wide at the mind flayer, and 20 feet wide at the opposite end. All within the cone must make a saving throw vs. wands or be stunned and unable to act for 3d4 rounds. The illithid tries to grab one or two stunned victims (requiring normal attack rolls if others try to prevent this) and escape with them.
    The illithid keeps some victims as slaves and feeds on the brains of the others. When devouring the brain of a stunned victim, it inserts its tentacles into the victimâ€™s skull and draws out its brain, killing the victim in one round. A mind flayer can also use its tentacles in combat; it does so only when surprised or when attacking a single, unarmed victim. A tentacle which hits causes 2 hp damage and holds the victim. A tentacle does no damage while holding, and can be removed with a successful bend bars/lift gates roll. Once all four tentacles have attached to the victim, the mind flayer has found a path to the brain and kills the victim in one round. If preferred, the DM can simply roll 1d4 for the number of rounds required to kill a struggling victim.
    A mind flayer can also use the following arcane powers, one per round, as a 7th-level mage: suggestio , charm perso , charm monster , ESP , levitate , astral projectio , and plane shift . All saving throws against these powers are made at a -4, due to the creature's mental prowess.
    If an encounter is going against a mind flayer, it will immediately flee, seeking to save itself regardless of its treasure or its fellows.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Mind flayers hate sunlight and avoid it when possible. They live in underground cities of 200 to 2,000 illithids, plus at least two slaves per illithid. All the slaves are under the effects of a charm perso or charm monster , and obey their illithid masters without question.
    The center of a community is its elder brain, a pool of briny fluid that contains the brains of the cityâ€™s dead mind flayers. Due to the mental powers of illithids, the elder brain is still sentient, and the telepathic union of its brains rules the community. The elder brain has a telepathic range of 2 to 5 miles, depending on its age and size. It does not attack, but telepathically warns the mind flayers of the presence of thinking creatures, so a mind flayer within its telepathic radius can be surprised only by non-intelligent creatures. The range of the elder brain determines the territory claimed and defended by the community, though raiding parties are sent far beyond this limit.
    Mind flayers have no family structure. Their social activities include eating, communicating with the elder brain, and debating on the best tactics to conquer the Underdark. For amusement, they inflict pain on their captives and force slaves to fight in gladiatorial games.
    Mind flayers are arrogant, viewing all other species only as cattle to be fed upon. They prefer to eat the brains of thinking creatures.
  Ecology: |
    Mind flayers live about 125 years. They are warm-blooded amphibians, and spend the first 10 years of life as tadpoles, swimming in the elder-brain pool until they either die (which most do) or grow into adult illithids. On an irregular basis, adult illithids feed brains to the tadpoles, which do not molest the elder brain. Illithids are hermaphroditic; each can produce one tadpole twice in its life.
    Mind flayer ichor is an effective ingredient in a potion of ESP.

    Psionic flayers, considered the only true illithids by some (including themselves), have most of the same statistics and abilities as other mind flayers. Instead of magic-based abilities, however, theirs are purely psionic. Psionic mind flayers have a beak-like mouth and disdain the stiff-collared robes preferred by their cousins.
    Illithids use psionics for attack, mind control, and travel.

  Description: |
    An infinity vine is a leafless, bright green plant with an extremely rapid rate of growth. It consists of an enormous number of thin, interwoven stems, all part of the same plant. Numerous bright blue flowers appear throughout the plant, each only Â½" across. These flowers draw nutrients and moisture for the plant directly from the air itself. The plant thrives so long as it is kept within a crystal sphere 's wildspace and exposed to both breathable air and to light of any kind. An infinity vine grows very rapidly, seeming to create plant material out of thin air.
  Combat: |
    The infinity vine poses a special hazard in the wildspace of many crystal spheres. Bits of this plant are often broken off and discarded from infested ships, and these dormant bits sometimes drift into the atmosphere and gravity field of a spelljamming ship. If a bit of vine falls against an air-bearing ship or other space object (including an asteroidal body of less than 100 miles diameter), the vine begins to grow outward at the rate of ten cubic feet per round. If unchecked, it eventually grows to a depth of ten feet over every surface until it completely covers the exterior of the ship or asteroid (but it does not reach into dark spaces).
    The gravest danger that an infinity vine poses is that it adds to the overall tonnage of any spelljamming ship it covers, and it does so very quickly. When this plant has covered an entire shape it will have increased the ship's tonnage to four times its original value. This has obvious and immediate effects on spelljamming procedures.
    An infinity vine consumes the waste gases given off by airbreathing creatures, and it gives off large quantities of oxygen (see "Ecology"). It is harmless to living beings, though it grows around and buries slow-moving or immobile beings. Victims can tear through an infinity vine (which regrows behind them as they pass) at their movement rate in feet per turn, if using bare hands or sheer force. A being with claws or a short-bladed weapon (dagger or smaller) can move at double this rate, and a being with a bladed weapon at least as large as a short sword can hack through the vine at triple this rate.
    An infinity vine is destroyed by any amount of direct contact with flame, and it stops growing (but stays green) if placed underwater or in total darkness. As burning is not a practical solution for clearing an infested ship, the spelljamming crew must either head for the phlogisto to scrape off every bit of dried vine, stop in a planet 's shadow out of the sunlight, or land on a large planet, where after a one-hour delay the infinity vine disappears just as quickly as it grew (ten cubic feet per round) until it has vanished.
    Fire-, acid-, and electricity-based spells destroy all of the infinity vine within their areas of effect, though the vine regrows from unaffected areas. Cold-based spells cause it to stop growing for one round per hit point of damage inflicted (but only within the areas of effect). A darkness spell causes it to stop growing. Haste , slow , entangle , spike growth , anti-plant shell , plant door , transport via plants , and enlarge/reduce spells have their normal effects, though a size-altered plant immediately either grows or shrinks at a proportionately altered rate to fill its original volume. Magic missile spell damage is regrown almost instantly. Plant growth spells cause it to grow at a rate of 100 cubic feet per round (though still limited to ten feet deep over the surface it is on). Charm plant and hold plant spells can cause the vine to stop growing within the areas of effect.
    The infinity vine is immune to all known plant diseases and to poisons of any form (including the cloudkill spell). It cannot be polymorphed, energy drained, or slain by death magic.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Infinity vine can radically transform small asteroids into havens for bizarre ecological systems. The vine expands the air envelope around any object it engulfs so that the envelope is twice as thick as it formerly was. Castaways and exiles are sometimes found on such worlds, as a steady air and food supply is provided by the vine. Infinity vine is edible, though unappetizing.

  Description: |
    Insectare are a humanoid race rumored to be the descendants of a magical union of elves and insects. The insectare's goal is to rule the spaceways, but they wage this campaign subtly, trying to play one race against another. While instigating these problems, the insectare try to stay in the background.
    These humanoids are immediately recognizable by their limegreen skin and the two eight-foot antennae that sprout from behind their elven ears. For this reason, they wear heavy, concealing clothes such as large robes with hoods pulled in close. That way, an insectare can hide its antennae by slipping them down its back or coiling them in the folds of a loosely-fitting robe.
    Close examination of an insectare's eyes reveals that they are slightly multifaceted. Getting that close may prove difficult, though, as insectare do not ordinarily allow other races near them. From five feet away, the eyes look normal.
    No one has ever reported seeing a female insectare, but for that matter, not many people have even seen a male insectare without a hood. Therefore, they could have been dealing with a female and not noticed.
    Insectare can communicate with each other by touching their antennae together. They also have their own language, a clicking, lilting tongue that is a mixture of the common tongue and the insects' original language. Characters who understand the common tongue have a 30% chance of catching the general idea of a conversation between two insectare, but cannot provide a comprehensive translation for others.
    Most insectare stand 6' or taller and are heavily muscled beneath their tough exoskeleton. Most insectare encountered outside their home sphere are fighters, wizards, thieves, or any combination of the three.
  Combat: |
    Insectare are ruthless in battle. Once a fight has begun, they never give up until the enemy is completely defeated. They chase fleeing foes to exact surrender, and they execute survivors who refuse surrender.
    Insectare use a long sword and their two antennae, which attack as whips (1d2 damage). Often, one antenna entangles the opponent's weapon hand (with an attack roll of 18 or better) while the other antenna and sword attack. An entangled limb cannot attack; to disentangle the limb, the character must make a Dexterity ability check.
    In combat, the insectare's chitinous exoskeleton provides an Armor Class equivalent to plate mail, without restricting movement. The exoskeleton has no known weak points.
    Insectare wizards jealously guard their magic, relying on their martial skills to bring them through a battle. The insectare obviously have magical ability, since they can spelljam, but the limits of insectare power remain unknown. Insectare wizards never reveal information without overwhelming reason. (The threat of death doesn't qualify.)
  Habitat/Society: |
    Insectare live in a closed society. They forbid outsiders to set foot on their secret homeworld. Captured interlopers can expect a harsh interrogation, to find out if any other beings know of the world's location, and then public execution. Insectare do not believe in keeping prisoners.
    Insectare live in large hollowed-out mountains that rise out of the endless forests of their homeworld. These mountains are said to be honeycombed with dwellings. Not much is known about these community homes, but they are probably a remnant of their insect heritage.
    The two major classes of insectare society are the wizards and the priests. The wizards are the explorers, forever searching wildspace for more magical power. The priests stay on their planet, diligently serving their god, Klikral.
    The insectare mages' goal, after learning spelljamming , was to acquire magical knowledge and power from other races, without drawing attention to their goals. Consequently, insectare prefer to work subtly among foreigners.
    Some insectare are proficient thieves, despite the aversion to thieves on their homeworld. Insectare thieves are only interested in magic; gold, jewelry, gems hold no attraction. When an insectare steals a powerful magic item, it often leaves at least one misleading clue, pointing at another known thief (such as a player character).
    Insectare priests rarely leave their homeworld, for they prefer not to venture far from Klikral. If a priest is found offworld, its mission must be highly important to the insectare race. Klikral grants insectare priests who reach 2nd level one special ability: They can summon insects from the surrounding area and send them against any one opponent. This swarm of insects arrives in one round, inflicts 1d8 points of damage per round, and remains for one round per level of the spellcaster.
    Unlike other insectare, priests have normal humanoid eyes. No explanation has been found for this difference. The symbol of one multifaceted eye with two antennae off the two corners means that the owner or creator is an insectare wizard, fighter, or thief; a similar symbol, with a regular eye and two antennae represents an insectare priest. These two symbols, obviously signatures of some sort, appear on stolen insectare documents.
    Multiclass options for insectare are wizard/fighter, wizard/thief and wizard/fighter/thief. Priests never engage in another profession. Insectare can reach 11th level in all classes except wizard, where they reach 14th level.
    Ten ancient insectare priests on the insectare homeworld serve as high priests of Klikral. They are all 11th-level priests and never leave the planet. They are twice as large as the usual insectare, and can communicate directly with Klikral.
    The insectare travel space in their own distinctive ship, the klicklikak . The sleek ship resembles a grasshopper head with two long antennae trailing behind it. The name means "service to Klikral".
    The insectare power the klicklikak with a special spelljammer helm consisting of a shiny copper sphere with two holes. To propel the ship through space, the spelljammer inserts its two antennae. Only insectare can use this helm; conversely, insectare cannot use other kinds of helm.
    Rumors have it that a new, larger version of the klicklikak roams the spaceways, but no sightings are confirmed.
  Ecology: |
    Spacefaring peoples shun the insectare, especially elves. Elves vehemently deny any suggestion that they are related to the insectare. Insectare, aware of this discord, go to great lengths to remain inconspicuous while among elves and other foreigners. Although other races don't know much about the insectare master plan, they note the insectare's secrecy and deviousness, which puts many people on guard.
    A good weaponsmith can work the outer skin of an insectare, which is a hard exoskeleton, into a +1 shield, and can fashion an antenna into a short rope or whip. However, insectare consider this practice abominable, and anyone who uses such a weapon or shield earns every insectare's instant hatred.

  Description: |
    The term "intellect devourer" refers only to this creature's adult form; its larva is an ustilagor. Both resemble a brain on four legs. The body of the intellect devourer has a crusty protective covering, and its legs are bestial, jointed, and clawed. The ustilagor's body is soft and moist and usually covered with a gray fungus; it has a 3-foot-long tendril at the front, and its legs are spindly and coral-like. Though both forms are about brain-sized, the adult can use psionics to alter its size.
  Combat: |
    The ustilagor attacks by striking with its flexible tendril. The tendril secretes an alkaline substance which causes 1d4+1 damage on a successful hit, as well as another 1d4+1 damage the following round, unless the victim makes a successful saving throw vs. poison. The creature is quite agile, and can jump and dart quickly.
    The ustilagor can also attack psionically, first making contact with a victim's mind. It uses aversion to give a victim an aversion to fungus or to a certain area; id insinuation to effectively paralyze the victim; or telempathic projection to increase an opponent's dislike or distrust of companions.
    Despite its psionic prowess, the ustilagor cannot be attacked mentally (magically or psionically) except by psionic blast. Its fungal growth interferes with and prevents mental attacks, protects the ustilagor from drying out, prevents cerebral parasites from attacking, and makes the creature immune to fungal attacks and any power that reads or affects an aura.
    The adult form also prefers to attack with psionics, though its three-taloned paws can all be used in the same round, as the creature jumps on an opponent and rakes.
    Aside from its regular psionic powers (see below), the adult intellect devourer has specialized forms of three psionic powers; these are constantly in effect and cost no PSPs, but they do count as psionic activity for detection purposes. Through a special form of energy containment, the intellect devourer is immune to damage from normal and magical fires, and takes only one hit point per die of electrical damage; a form of split personality is always in effect, allowing the creature to attack with psionics and claws in the same round; and it has psionic sense with a 60 foot range.
    The intellect devourer is immune to weapons with less than a +3 enchantment, and takes only 1 point of damage per hit from those weapons which can harm them. A death spell has only a 25% chance of success, but power word kill is effective. A protection from evil keeps the intellect devourer at bay, and bright light (including that caused by fire) drives it away.
    An intellect devourer hunts and stalks psionic creatures. After killing a psionic victim, it sometimes uses reduction to enter the body, devour the brain, and occupy its place. It reads the victim's mind as it devours it, then animates the body from within, using it to find other minds to attack and devour.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Intellect devourers dwell beneath the ground or in dismal wilderness areas. Their reproductive method is unknown. The intellect devourer rarely protects its young, and may even devour them. Ustilagor develop a symbiotic relationship with a bizarre fungus which feeds on residual thought emanations from the ustilagor's victims. An ustilagor becomes an adult by consuming the brain of a psionic creature.
  Ecology: |
    Mind flayers raise intellect devourers, treating the ustilagor as culinary delights, and using adults as watch dogs. Both forms of the creature can be used as components in items and potions related to ESP and mind control.

  Description: |
    Resembling the barnacle-like immature krajens , jammer leeches are unwittingly attracted by the spellcasters who power ships through wildspace and the phlogisto . They can be very dangerous if mishandled, and they always cause the ships they infest a great deal of trouble.
    A jammer leech has a hard shell, which grows to be a foot tall. The shell can be of almost any color, though it closely matches that of the hull of the ship it is attached to. (This makes spotting the leech very difficult from casual observation alone.) Inside, the leech is reddish-purple in color, with a body much like that of a snail. It has a single, watery eye at one end. It also possesses a sharply spiked tentacle, which is the same color and consistency as its body.
  Combat: |
    In most situations, the jammer leech uses its tentacle for protection. The sharp spikes on the end of the foot-long arm cause 1d4 points of damage. That is often enough to discourage most creatures from harassing the parasite.
    In a situation where a hard swipe from a tentacle doesn't discourage a predator, the jammer leech uses magic. As it rests upon the hull, close to the spelljammer helm , the leech draws magical energy from the wizard or priest powering the ship. For every ten days of jamming, the leech absorbs one spell â€“ of any level â€“ at random from the spellcaster's mind. On a trip that takes 30 days, for example, the leech would be able to absorb three spells. Luckily, jammer leeches can hold only four spells at a time. However, when more than one leech attaches itself to a ship, they each draw spells from the spelljammer. Spellcasters who are preyed upon by jammer leeches forget the spell absorbed by the parasite and must regain it in the normal manner. However, the wizard or priest notices the missing spell only if he attempts to recall it; otherwise, the loss goes undetected.
    In combat, the jammer leech discharges the spells it has stolen at random. The parasite uses all the magic it has stored, one spell per round, to drive away its assailant. The spell is cast at the level at which the victimized spellcaster would cast it. If more than one mage or priest powered the helm during the ten days, the average level is used.
    There are only two effective ways to deal with a magic-laden jammer leech: kill it with a single strike or cast a separate dispel magic spell on each parasite to disarm it before striking. However, the leech has 25% resistance to magic, so attacking the creature is always a risky business. Once its magic reserve is gone and the parasite's hard shell is cracked, it is an easy target.
    It is important to note that leeches will use their spells to ward off any physical attack. They frequently discharge their spells during any battle in which their section of the hull is repeatedly struck. Sometimes this works in favor of the leech's host ship, but more often it proves to be disastrous.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Since a jammer leech does not need air to survive, it can be found almost anywhere there are spelljammers. Beginning as a spore, the jammer leech attaches itself to the hull of a ship, at a spot close to the spelljamming helm. The spore digs into the hull, then draws food and nutrients from the ship's surface at a rate of 1 hull point a month. After only one week on the ship, the spore develops a hard shell that roughly matches the color of the hull itself. The shell is attached to the ship by a strong, glue-like substance secreted by the leech, making the task of scraping it from the hull time consuming and tedious.
    These parasites are found in small groups of four or less. If more than two leeches are encountered, there is a 10% chance they are a mated pair that produces 1d6 spores once per month. Some of these may quickly join their parents on the hull of the ship, while others float off, waiting to attach themselves to another unwary vessel.
  Ecology: |
    Jammer leeches have few intelligent natural predators, for most creatures quickly learn that attacking these parasites is painful, if not deadly. Some omnivores, such as zards , try to eat leeches as they would anything else, but the parasite can usually warn these creatures off with a sharp swipe of their tentacle.
    The glue that the leeches excrete to hold their shells to a hull is extremely strong and highly prized. The gooey purple substance is waterproof, fireproof, and even slightly magic resistant (5%). The dangers involved in collecting live leeches and maintaining them limits this market, however, and the glue is rare and very expensive.

  Description: |
    The k'r'r'r are sentient spiders that developed in deep space . Unfettered by a dependency on gravity, the k'r'r'r are not locked into the two-dimensional thought processes that seem to affect other races. Their homes and ships can be built of three-, four-, or five-sided designs to suit their needs.
    The k'r'r'r are firm in their belief that their place is at the apex of creation. The rest of the Known Spheres is a larder for their kitchens and a quarry for their constructions. It is their destiny to exploit all the resources that their gods have made available to them. The k'r'r'rs' duty is to organize themselves so that they may fully grasp that destiny.
    The k'r'r'r look like thin spiders resting on stiltlike legs. Whereas most spiderlike beings are relatively horizontal with bodies held close to the ground, the k'r'r'r are upright with torsos held 2 feet off the ground. This disparity is attributed to a superior design granted by the gods.
    The k'r'r'r come in shades of black and dark blue. A sky-blue strain is a natural mutation, and they are considered touched by the gods and treated with inordinate respect.
  Combat: |
    The forward pair of legs are smaller than the other six, and they end in delicate claws used for manipulating tools and weapons. The head is multieyed but dominated by two primary orbs. The multiple eyes coupled with high Intelligence provide the race with a +4 to saving throws versus illusion/phantasm spells. The head also has great jaws that allow the k'r'r'r to bite if it is weaponless.
    K'r'r'r prefer spears, pole arms, and other piercing weapons to the shorter weapons such as maces. They are physically hampered when using weapons that require slashing strokes, such as swords, and they suffer a -1 to hit penalty with them. K'r'r'r do not use bows, but they can use specially modified and mounted crossbows and starwheel pistols, though each weapon takes an additional round for the k'r'r'r to load. In combat, the k'r'r'r who have such weapons fire the first round then use their pole arms thereafter. Those without a secondary weapon will bite for 1-4 points of damage.
    One k'r'r'r in 10 has exceptional abilities. Half of these are higher level fighters, with additional 1-6 HD. The other half are specialist priests of levels 3-12. These specialized priests have limited access to spells (All, Guardian, Protection, and Sun spheres only), and they are used primarily as helmsmen for exploration and colonization vessels.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The k'r'r'r believe they have the right to colonize and exploit the remainder of the universe. Their logic to support this philosophy is straightforward: Other races in space apparently come from one groundling society or another â€“ they have no more purpose in space than does a fish on land. The k'r'r'r, however, were born to the void.
    To that end the k'r'r'r are expanding their infiltration of various spheres through use of their unity fleets. These fleets are like caravans to the stars, identical ships being constructed and sent out one after another. The ships are modular, and once they arrive on the scene they can link up to form larger, more powerful ships to defeat an enemy. The peculiar nature of the k'r'r'r allows their ships to move quickly on a tactical scale, even if the ships have linked together and exceed the normal 100-ton limit. It is a combination of the k'r'r'rs' mindset and their specialized helms that allows them to pull off this maneuver â€“ a maneuver that other races, even with k'r'r'r helms, have not been able to duplicate.
    The k'r'r'r are led by their strongest fighter, supported by priests. The fighter and priests are likened to empty vessels that must be filled by the k'r'r'r spider-god called the Wise Quee . Her body is jet black, and she has a humanish mold to her face. The k'r'r'r consider her superior to all other gods just as the k'r'r'r are superior to all other creatures.
    There is a disturbing similarity between the k'r'r'r Wise Queen and the Dark Elves' Llolth . The drow goddess is extremely chaotic and utterly evil â€“ could she be advising and providing spiritual leadership for a group of neutral but primarily lawful spider-creatures? The answer is unknown.
  Ecology: |
    The k'r'r'r are carnivores and will eat any creature, including their own dead, in order to survive. However, they are extremely efficient feeders end do not need to eat often, and a single meal will hold a k'r'r'r for two months or more. There will be dried meats of unknown origin on k'r'r'r ships.

  Description: |
    The kasharin are those beholders who contracted the Blinding Rot disease and who survived long enough to seemingly die from the disease and not from beholder retaliation. (The Blinding Rot caused the beholders' eye stalks to wither and decay and subsequently fall off, leaving the beholder severely disabled if not dead. At least half of the beholders aboard the Spelljammer acquired the disease, but most of those afflicted were killed by their fellow beholders during the early stages of the disease, so great is the race's xenophobia over any disparity in the eye tyrant race.)
    The disease did not actually kill the creatures, but rather placed them in a state of living death. They still register as living beings according to the shivaks ' ability to detect life, and thus they still receive food rations from the ship's stores. The kasharin operate on that thin edge between the living and the undead , but for how long they can remain so is unknown. Currently they are being cared for by the beholders in their tower; the kasharin are given healing magic and minimum food rations to maintain their existence in the event that they can be made into servants for the Gray Eye (the leader of the beholders aboard the Spelljammer ).
    The kasharin appear to be blackened, burnt beholders, their scales curled and separated, apparently from some intense heat. Their eye stalks are charred and useless, but their central eye still remains intact and usable.
  Combat: |
    The beholder-mummies' main form of attack is their central eye. It retains the range it had when alive, but the eye now has a two-pronged attack. The eye acts as a powerful charm perso / monster to those characters or creatures who are affected by such spells; to those who are not, it acts as an equally powerful ray of death magic.
    Any who encounter the kasharin make their saving throws at -4. If they can be charmed and fail their first saving throw, they continue to make all successive saving throws to shake off the charm at -4 as well. Creatures and characters that cannot be charmed because of inner magic resistance or immunity must make a saving throw versus death magic at -4, with failure indicating immediate death.
    Beholder-mummies can be turned or destroyed if confronted with sufficient clerical power. Treat them like ghosts or other 10 HD monsters.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The beholder-mummies retain their xenophobic hatred, but the hatred is now focused on all surviving living beholders. The kasharin's new state has, curiously enough, made them more forgiving toward the denizens of the undead, but these feelings occur only if the undead cannot otherwise affect the beholder-mummies.
    Only beholders that have passed completely through the transformation caused by the Blinding Rot are considered "true" beholders by the kasharin. To them, the beholders of any subrace that have passed "the test" are now considered brethren, while any former (and living) relations are not, regardless of whether they were once the same subrace. The xenophobic hatred that drives multiple subraces apart in the world of the living beholder has been simplified to simply living versus unliving in the beholder-mummy world. The transformation to undead may prove to be a blessing in disguise for the strife-ridden beholder factions.
  Ecology: |
    The kasharin are products of the disease that has transformed them into their present state. They are changed both in body and in mind, yet they retain many of the their natural beholder tendencies.
    The beholders kept within the tower have now been metamorphosed into beholder-mummies, but the plague itself originally came from beyond the decks of the Spelljammer . It may be that there are colonies (and perhaps even entire planets ) of beholders so infected somewhere in the Known Spheres.
    The Blinding Rot was originally developed as an ultimate unifier of the beholder race. The philosophy behind its development is that it brings the beholders â€“ every race, subrace, and sub-subrace â€“ together in a single, unifying death. Rising from the ashes of that death is a new race, a single race of beholder-mummies. All creatures of space must fall to the beholders, and now all the undead must fall to the beholder-mummies.

  Description: |
    Kindori are called space whales , and they are among the largest living creatures found in space . They resemble aquatic whales in general shape and are mammals as well. However, they lack any noticeable mouth, and the leading edge of their fishlike bodies is dotted with small eyes.
  Combat: |
    The kindori tend to be peaceful except when threatened. In normal conditions, this usually means a direct attack, but during herding periods (see below), any individual approaching the herd is seen as a danger.
    The kindori's main physical weapon is its massive tail flukes, which it uses to batter its opponents. While kindori recognize the presence of humans , beholders , and other small creatures, they direct such attacks first and foremost against the ships that are almost their size. The kindori work together to batter a single attacker to bits, then go to the next one, until all assailants are defeated.
    The leading eyes of the kindori can emit a concentrated blast of light. This light is projected as a cone in the direction of the kindori's choice, with a 500-yard range and a base of 400 yards. All those within the cone must save vs. breath weapon or be blinded for 4-16 rounds. The kindori will use this form of attack against individuals they cannot beat, using the confusion it creates to escape.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The kindori travel in small groups, called pods, of 2-8 members. For large (7-8 member) pods, there will be a bull of maximum hit points present. This bull will be the forward line of defense if the pod is attacked.
    Every so often (roughly annually, depending on the sphere ), several pods will gather together into a larger herd of 3-30 members. There will be 3-6 bulls present in such a herd, and during this time, any ships that pass near the herds will be attacked. During herding the male kindori are particularly violent, engaging in tail-slapping contests with other young males (and often with ships that come too close). These tail-slappings create a pecking order within the herd, which in turn determines the mating rights of the various members. The oldest bulls always have first rights among the females, followed by the more powerful young.
    The kindori young gestate for six months and are born live in space. A herd will be extremely protective during this time, since the young are prey to scavvers and other attackers.
    With these exceptions, kindori are generally peaceful and have been domesticated by a number of spaceborne barbarians. Such groups either travel short distances, such as within an asteroid belt, cluster, or ring; or are far-ranging space nomads making long voyages. The kindori is large enough to maintain its own gravity plane and air envelope, and has no need for air of its own.
    The size of the kindori is such that mosses, molds, and other parasites nest on their large backs, which in turn brings other predators to clean them off. A kindori might (20% chance) have 3-18 gray or brown scavvers working over the growing population on their sides.
    Some kindori that have been domesticated (see below) later go feral as their masters die or let them loose. These kindori sometimes have the ruins of old buildings (generally called howdahs) on their backs, along with more terrestrial plant and animal life. Such structures and life survive only on the back and sides of the kindori.
  Ecology: |
    A kindori does not eat as do most other creatures of space. It instead soaks in the rays of the su , stars, and other shining bodies in its area of space. The "belly" of the kindori is dotted with tiny white patches, each of which sends energy deep within the creature, to be stored within its large mass.
    Keeping this belly clean of parasites is a common act of herd behavior, as the great creatures rub each other to flake off old skin and parasites. They are less concerned with their backs, which is why small islands of life often spring up there.
    An extremely old or sick kindori can be spotted by the overgrowth of vine and vegetation on it. Such creatures are near death, and often fall prey to the larger scavvers and other creatures.
    Even in death kindori are powerful creatures, as their skeletons do not break up when parasites destroy their flesh. Undead creatures such as liches and vampires often use skeletal kindori as their ships for slow, leisurely invasions of new lands (the undead have forever). Such dead kindori have 15 hull points, plus whatever modifications (weapons, etc.) are made to them.
    There have been stories of hitching a spelljamming helm to a kindori. It is generally agreed that the action of moving at spelljamming speeds spooks them, and even domesticated kindori will head off for parts unknown, seeking to scrape the irritating helm from their flesh. Some skeletal kindori have been fitted with such helms by undead marauders and used as warships.
    The kindori have many natural enemies, including the kraje , the radiant dragons , and the various humaniform races. Beholders and mind flayers , sensitive to the creature's light-emitting eyes, have a particular dislike of them. The former will avoid kindori whenever possible, while the latter will engage in wholesale slaughter of them, massing armadas to take out whole pods that lie too close to their outposts.
    The flesh of the kindori can be rendered into oil, much like the aquatic whale, and it is this kindori flesh that is the source of most greek fire for various races. The lizard me , who use greek fire regularly, often put together whaling parties to hunt kindori, and are working on a mobile base, towed in pieces by multiple wasp -class ships, that can render the flesh of the creature in the field.
  Domesticated Kindori: |
    Savage races in space will often use the kindori for short-range travel, usually in the period before they gain enough savvy and trading goods to deal with the arcane on a regular basis. The "savage races" vary from empires ruled by philosopher kings, to degenerate standard races, to savage marauders who will attack everything in sight.
    The kindori can be domesticated, but the savage races will operate in them in pod or herd groups, and will not split the kindori family groups. Only old solitary bulls will be found on their own, and then usually on exploration duty.
    The savage races (which can be human, dwarf , elf , gnome , or eve halfling ) do not cut into the flesh of the kindori, but rather secure buildings, weapon platforms, and the like with short hooks that lightly snag the thick hide of the beast. The savage races will often maintain farms and herd terrestrial beasts on the backs of such creatures, since the kindori have no need of the atmosphere around them.
    A typical kindori/savage race group will number some 2-8 kindori, each with a crew of 10-20 warriors. Dress and weapons vary from place to place, from bone spears to bronze armor and short swords. There will be at most one light catapult per kindori, save for the bulls, which can carry heavy catapults. The crew arrangements will be an extension of the savage's native group, with a captain or shaman or chieftain leading the herd.
    The savages will trade with spaceborne races (if they are peaceful), but do not like or trust spelljammer helms, which make their mounts mad.

  Description: |
    Kobolds are a cowardly, sadistic race of short humanoids that vigorously contest the huma and demi-human races for living space and food. They especially dislike gnomes and attack them on sight.
    Barely clearing 3 feet in height, kobolds have scaly hides that range from dark, rusty brown to a rusty black. They smell of damp dogs and stagnant water. Their eyes glow like a bright red spark and they have two small horns ranging from tan to white. Because of the kobolds' fondness for wearing raggedy garb of red and orange, their non-prehensile rat-like tails, and their language (which sounds like small dogs yapping), these fell creatures are often not taken seriously. This is often a fatal mistake, for what they lack in size and strength they make up in ferocity and tenacity.
    Kobolds speak their own language; some (75%) speak orc and gobli.
  Combat: |
    The kobold approach to combat uses overwhelming odds or trickery. Kobolds will attack gnomes on sight, but will think twice about attacking humans, elves , or dwarves unless the kobolds outnumber them by at least two to one. They often hurl javelins and spears, preferring not to close until they see that their enemies have been weakened.
    Kobolds attack in overwhelming waves. Should the kobolds be reduced to only a three to two ratio in their favor, they must make a morale check. Kobolds are wary of spellcasters and will aim for them when possible.
    This diminutive race also enjoys setting up concealed pits with spikes, crossbows, and other mechanical traps. They usually have view ports and murder holes near these traps so that they can pour flaming oil, missile weapons, or drop poisonous insects on their victims.
    Kobold war bands are armed with spiked clubs, axes, javelins, short swords and spears. Their shields are seldom metal, but are normally wood or wicker. Chiefs and guards tend to have the best weapons available.
    Kobolds have 60-foot infravision but do not see well in bright sunlight, suffering a -1 on their attack rolls.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Kobolds live in dark, damp places underground and in overgrown forests. They can be found in almost any climate. As kobolds are good miners, any area with potential for mining is fair game for settlement.
    The average kobold tribe has 40-400 (4d10Ã—10) adult males. For every 40 kobolds in a band there will be one leader and two bodyguards (AC 6; HD 1-1; hp 4 each; damage 1-6). In a lair there will be 5-20 (5d4) bodyguards, females equal to 50% of the males, young equal to 10% of the males and 30-300 (3d10Ã—10) eggs. There will also be a chief and 2-8 guards (AC 5; HD 1+1; hp 7 each; damage 1-8). Further, there is a 65% chance there will be guard animals: (70%) 2-5 wild boars (AC 7; HD 3+3; damage 3d4 gore) or (30%) 1-4 giant weasels (AC 6; HD 3+3; damage 2d6 bite and blood drain). There may be one or more shamans.
    Their society is tribal but can be further broken up into war bands based on specific clans. As many as 10 families can be part of a clan, and each clan usually is responsible for controlling the area in a 10 mile radius from the lair. Kobolds recover treasure from the bodies of their victims and often carry them back to their lair as food. In some instances, kobolds will not kill their victims, but will sell them as slaves.
    Kobolds are distrustful of strangers. They hate brownies, pixies, sprites and gnomes. Gnomes are never eaten or taken prisoner.
  Ecology: |
    Perhaps kobolds are so cruel because they are easy prey for larger humanoids and hungry monsters. They have many enemies, and even the dwarves have had to admit that the numerous kobold-goblin wars have kept the number of goblins down to a safe level.
    Kobolds can live 135 years.
  Urd: |
    Urds are distant relatives of kobolds. Three feet tall, with short ivory horns, their bodies are frail and covered with mottled yellow to brick red scales. Their leathery, batlike wings span 8 feet.
    Urds have 60-foot infravision and prefer to hunt at night, dropping jagged stones (2-3 pounds each) from the air. Unsuspecting victims are AC 10 for the attack roll. Actively dodging opponents are considered AC 2 before modifications to Dexterity. Rocks cause 2d4 points of damage. Some urds (25%) carry light sprears (1d4 damage).
    A band of 20 urds is accompanied by a subchieftain (AC 7, 7 hp). Urd flocks of 100 or more include the chieftain (10 hp, 50% have magical leather armor). Urd lairs contain 1d6 shamans able to speak with bats as per speak with animals.
    Urd life spans can exceed 100 years, but they rarely live past 50.

  Description: |
    The krajen develops in three stages: small spaceborne spores, a barnaclelike immature stage, and the huge, adult krajen that is the bane of the shipways. In its adult stage, the krajen can grow longer than most ships, and resembles a gargantuan aquatic squid. Its tubelike body is dominated at one end by a thick central tentacle, the base of which is surrounded by a cluster of smaller tentacles.
  Combat: |
    Adult krajens are holy terrors, attacking anything that comes within comfortable distance of them with a huge central tentacle and a cluster of twelve lesser tentacles. The krajen's central tentacle can crush objects of more than huge size, inflicting either 3-30 hit points or 1-3 hull points of damage, depending on the target. On a hit of 18 or better, the central tentacle has looped around the target and can crush each round thereafter automatically. Even when not crushing the life out of a victim, the central tentacle can inflict up to 3-18 points of damage in combat.
    The smaller tentacles that ring the large central tentacle are called sentries, and act to protect the main shaft. They are thin, snakelike members, tipped with a paralysis poison that causes those hit to save vs. poison or be paralyzed for 3-30 rounds. The adult krajen can use all its tentacles at one time, though no more than two tentacles will engage a man-sized target.
    A common krajen tactic is to snare a ship and crush it with the central tentacle, while the smaller sentries deal with the crew and other creatures trying to attack it. Only after all the attackers are paralyzed or slain will the krajen feed, crushing the paralyzed survivors. The krajen will feed over several days, fall into slumber for a few months, then move off for new conquests.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The krajen has no real social organization. The monstrous adult krajens are solitary creatures, and should one encounter another, it will treat it as any other creature and probably attack. The krajens are immune to their own paralysis poison and that of their young, and will destroy ships that are carrying their young and consume them as readily as not.
  Ecology: |
    In the krajen's youngest form, its spores are harmless, and can be slain by such simple spells as cure disease . They drift like windborne seeds in the void, waiting for the approach of a ship or other solid body. They are so small that a spelljamming ship can pass through a cloud of them without stopping and without its crew noticing. It is only when the spores take root in the hull of the ship that they are noticeable.
    Krajen spores can take root in any solid object, including asteroids , ship hulls, and large living creatures. Once planted, the base of the spore widens and digs into the surface while the outer surface hardens into a shell similar to a barnacle's. The central tentacle is nested in an opening at the top of this shell. In case of normal attacks on the immature krajen, the tentacle can whip out to attack enemies in the area, lashing out at random. When dormant, the tentacle is tucked inside the top of the shell.
    Immature krajens can survive without air, and in fact prefer the stale air of bad air envelopes over the healthy air of areas replenished by green plants. They do need a solid surface to draw nutrients from, though each one can also absorb nutrients from dead bodies that it and the rest of the colony have destroyed.
    When the immature krajens have pulled the equivalent of 2 hull points of material from a surface (i.e. in about two months), they disengage and float into space. At this point the gripping base closes and the sentry tentacles appear. Feeding on the stored, concentrated energy, the krajen attains its adult size and goes hunting. Large groups of immature krajens often hunt other krajens, until only one member of the group survives and reaches full size.
    Adult krajens grow throughout their entire lives, such that legends of particularly huge individuals surface from time to time. Krajens feed on ships almost accidentally, as their main prey are kindori , radiant dragons , and other large creatures.
    One rumor that has appeared in a number of spheres is of a lesser race of huma barbarians who have tamed the krajens through use of alchemic mixtures. They have traded these mixtures to the arcane in exchange for lifejammers , which they have hooked up to the relatively mindless kraken. Using the lifejammer-driven krajen, this lesser race is suddenly appearing as a major menace to shipping, often preying on other pirates and marauders.

  Description: |
    Lakshu are tall, beautiful, well-muscled, green-haired amazons. These teeth-gritting, armored harridans have laid waste to a thousand worlds, all in the name of their masters, the reigar . Lakshu have a fondness for tattoos, body paint, and ornate raiment (when not in battle dress). Their physical appearance is virtually identical; the only identifying marks are their tattoos, and their individual tastes in off-duty clothing. The principle form of identification comes from their individual shaktis (see entry on Reigar for complete shakti information). Consequently, each lakshu is known by her totem animal (e.g., Phoenix, Manta, etc.)
  Combat: |
    Lakshu are deadly in combat, exhibiting extreme proficiency in their weapon of choice. They are equally skilled in armed and unarmed combat, having been adapted by the reigar expressly as bodyguards/shock troops and shakti repair experts. Lakshu enter a berserker rage (morale 20, lasting until no opponents remain standing, +2 to attack and damage rolled) when reduced to half their hit point total.
    In battle, each lakshu can call and command up to three helots (golem-like creatures that have the same attacks as their organic counterparts: AC 2, MV by creature type, HD by creature type +2, unaffected by sleep and charm spells; helots do not have any special abilities or spell-like abilities their organic forms may possess). These helots are used by the reigar in coordination with the lakshu as organized fighting units, in addition to serving as crew members on the reigar esthetics.
  Habitat/Society: |
    It is not known how the association of the reigar and the lakshu came to be, but for as long as either race can remember they have been partners of sorts. The most accepted theory is that a raiding party of lakshu landed on the reigar homeworld with intent to dominate, little knowing what awaited them. (They had heard abut these namby-pamby artistes, but nothing was said to them about the lengths to which these artistes would go in their search for the ultimate experience.) As soon as the lakshu saw the shakti devices, they realized that an alliance was the best possible move for them. By accident it was discovered that the lakshu also had an affinity for shakti repair, which suited the reigar. (Repairs are not part of the reigar style â€“ they as repetitious and mundane, two concepts that are foreign to the reigar.)
    The reigar liked the lakshu's war-like temperament, and they were likewise pleased at the lakshu's ease with the shaktis. So the reigar set about appropriating the lakshu as a work of art. This entailed creating a uniform appearance for their race, in keeping with the reigar ideal of a single work of art. In this case, that meant re-creating the appearance of the lakshu as a whole, to gain the currently uniform height, weight, body mass, etc.
    Lakshu are now the elite troops of the reigar, and they serve as crew members on esthetics, in which capacity they are in charge of the daily operations of the crafts. In return for their services, lakshu receive room, board, travel, and (for those who are especially favored or who perform above and beyond the call) sometimes even gifts, uniquely created for them by their commanding reigar. And, of course, they are given personal shaktis that function in the same way as the reigar's.
    Their society, such as it is, is military in structure. Whenever two or more lakshu are present in one place, one must be superior to the others. A strict hierarchy is maintained, so that each lakshu knows her place and does not aspire to elevate herself. Lakshu reproduce via parthenogenesis. At specific times they give birth to a young lakshu, who is raised in a creche with the other offspring.
  Ecology: |
    Since their alliance with the reigar, the lakshu have become dependent on the esthetics for all their food needs. Their war-like raiding has been controlled as well; no longer are they laying waste at will. Now they lay waste when told to by their masters.

  Description: |
    The lhee are canine pranksters of wildspace , more of a nuisance than anything else. Their behavior swings wildly from acting like regular groundling dogs to being irresponsible imps.
    Although there are three types of lhee, they all share certain physical characteristics. All lhee have a pair of dextrous humanoid hands instead of front paws. Each type of lhee has a pair of great, snowy-white dove wings mounted just behind the shoulder blades. All lhee speak a language of yaps, growls, and woofs. They can also speak with blink dogs.
    The three types of lhee resemble different breeds of dogs. Lesser lhee resemble dachshunds, chihuahuas, and miniature poodles. Common lhee look like pit bull terriers, doberman pinschers, and rottweilers. Greater lhee appear as great danes, St. Bernards, and sheepdogs.
  Combat: |
    The common lhee's bite does 1d8 damage. The common lhee actively look for fights. All lhee can cast invisibility (at will), and audible glamer , dancing lights , blur , and darkness 15' radius three times a day each. Common lhee function as 3rd-level spellcasters.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The lhee have a definite hierarchy. The bigger lhee bully the smaller. A pack of lhee consists of all one type, though not necessarily all one breed. Each pack has a leader that the others follow, if they feel like it.
    A pack of lhee lairs inside caves or hollows in small moons or planetoids. Common lhee chew everything they find to small bits; consequently, they have no treasure.
    The life of a lhee consists of racing comets, eating, chasing spelljammers, eating, and annoying sailors. And eating. They exhibit some groundling dog habits such as a love for chasing felines, and a strong attraction to trees, wizard's staves, ship masts, and the like.
    Common lhee are the most violent, aggressive, and downright nasty lhee. They enjoy pulling pranks, though their jokes tend to be violent. ("Hey, let's push that torch-wielding halfling through that portal into the phlogisto !") They tend to be stupid, and the lesser lhee are forever tricking them.
  Lesser Lhee: |
    What the lesser lhee lack in size and ferocity, they make up in brains and mischief. They enjoy pestering spelljamming sailors by pulling little innocent pranks on them. Lesser lhee are the most intelligent type of space canine, and they prefer to wriggle out of combat situations by spell use. Lesser lhee have 50% skill in picking pockets. Lhee love to steal little things and commit small acts of sabotage on spelljammers.
    In addition to the spells available to the common lhee, the lesser lhee can cast grease , spook , and phantasmal force three times a day at 2nd level.
    Lesser lhee bite for 1d2 damage. These small animals avoid battle if at all possible.
  Greater Lhee: |
    Greater lhee act like big, friendly dogs. They exhibit many traits of groundling dogs, such as loyalty, frantic displays of happiness at seeing humans , a fierce love of playing, and a gullibility that shocks even the lesser lhee. For instance, a greater lhee will fetch a burning stick tossed into the phlogiston. Like other lhee, greater lhee love to play jokes on spelljamming sailors, though they believe the sailors want them to!
    Greater lhee have the same spell capability as the common lhee, casting spells at 6th level.
    The greater lhee's bite does 1d6 damage, and they are not reluctant to fight. They feel fights are part of a dog's life.
  Ecology: |
    Each pair of lhee encountered is a mated pair. There is a 10% chance that the pair have a litter of 2d4 puppies. These puppies have no powers or abilities until they reach adulthood at six months old.
    Lhee are difficult to train, though it is possible if the trainer can get a puppy no older than three weeks. Training takes a full year. Trained lhee are sometimes used as watchdogs, but this does not always work, since the dogs have a horrendously limited attention span.

  Description: |
    The lich is, perhaps, the single most powerful form of undead known to exist. They seek to further their own power at all costs and have little or no interest in the affairs of the living, except where those affairs interfere with their own.
    A lich greatly resembles a wight or mummy , being gaunt and skeletal in form. The creature's eye sockets are black and empty save for the fierce pinpoints of light which serve the lich as eyes. The lich can see with normal vision in even the darkest of environments but is unaffected by even the brightest light. An aura of cold and darkness radiates from the lich which makes it an ominous and fearsome sight. They were originally wizards of at least 18th level.
    Liches are often (75%) garbed in the rich clothes of nobility. If not so attired, the lich will be found in the robes of its former profession. In either case, the clothes will be tattered and rotting with a 25% chance of being magical in some way.
  Combat: |
    Although a lich will seldom engage in actual melee combat with those it considers enemies, it is more than capable of holding its own when forced into battle.
    The aura of magical power which surrounds a lich is so potent that any creature of fewer than 5 Hit Dice (or 5th level) which sees it must save vs. spell or flee in terror for 5-20 (5d4) rounds.
    Should the lich elect to touch a living creature, its aura of absolute cold will inflict 1-10 points of damage. Further, the victim must save vs. paralysis or be utterly unable to move. This paralysis lasts until dispelled in some manner.
    Liches can themselves be hit only by weapons of at least +1, by magical spells, or by monsters with 6 or more Hit Dice and/or magical properties. The magical nature of the lich and its undead state make it utterly immune to charm , sleep , enfeeblement , polymorph , cold, electricity, insanity, or death spells. Priests of at least 8th level can attempt to turn a lich, as can paladins of no less than 10th level.
    A lich is able to employ spells just as it did in life. It still requires the use of its spell books, magical components, and similar objects. It is important to note that most, if not all, liches have had a great deal of time in which to research and create new magical spells and objects. Thus, adventurers should be prepared to face magic the likes of which they have never seen before when stalking a lich. In addition, liches are able to use any magical objects which they might possess just as if they were still alive.
    Defeating a lich in combat is difficult indeed, but managing to actually destroy the creature is harder still. In all cases, a lich will protect itself from annihilation with the creation of a phylactery in which it stores its life force. This is similar to a magic jar spell. In order to ensure the final destruction of a lich, its body must be wholly annihilated and its phylactery must be sought out and destroyed in some manner. Since the lich will always take great care to see to it that its phylactery is well hidden and protected this can be an undertaking fully as daunting as the defeat of the lich in its physical form.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Liches are usually solitary creatures. They have cast aside their places as living beings by choice and now want as little to do with the world of men as possible. From time to time, however, a lich's interest in the world at large may be reawakened by some great event of personal importance.
    A lich will make its home in some ominous fortified area, often a strong keep or vast subterranean crypt.
    When a lich does decide to become involved with the world beyond its lair, its keen intelligence makes it a dangerous adversary. In some cases, a lich will depend on its magical powers to accomplish its goals. If this is not sufficient, however, the lich is quite capable of animating a force of undead troops to act on its behalf. If such is the case, the lich's endless patience and cunning more than make up for the inherent disadvantages of the lesser forms of undead which it commands.
    Although the lich has no interest in good or evil as we understand it, the creature will do whatever it must to further its own causes. Since it feels that the living are of little importance, the lich is often viewed as evil by those who encounter it. In rare cases, liches of a most unusual nature can be found which are of any alignment.
    The lich can exist for centuries without change. Its will drives it onward to master new magics and harness mystical powers not available to it in its previous life. So obsessed does the monster become with its quest for power that it often forgets its former existence utterly. Few liches call themselves by their old names when the years have drained the last vestiges of their humanity from them. Instead, they often adopt pseudonyms like "the Black Hand" or "the Forgotten King." Learning the true name of a lich is rumored to confer power over the creature.
  Ecology: |
    The lich is not a thing of this world. Although it was once a living creature, it has entered into an unnatural existence.
    In order to become a lich, the wizard must prepare its phylactery by the use of the enchant an item , magic jar , permanency and reincarnation spells. The phylactery, which can be almost any manner of object, must be of the finest craftsmanship and materials with a value of not less than 1,500 gold pieces per level of the wizard. Once this object is created, the would-be lich must craft a potion of extreme toxicity, which is then enchanted with the following spells: wraithform , permanency , cone of cold , feign death , and animate dead . When next the moo is full, the potion is imbibed. Rather than death, the potion causes the wizard to undergo a transformation into its new state. A system shock survival throw is required, with failure indicating an error in the creation of the potion which kills the wizard and renders him forever dead.
  Demilich: |
    The demilich is not, as the name implies, a weaker form of the lich. Rather, it is the stage into which a lich will eventually evolve as the power which has sustained its physical form gradually begins to fail. In most cases, all that remains of a demilich's body are a skull, some bones, and a pile of dust.
    When it has learned all that it feels it can in its undead life, the lich will continue its quest for power in strange planes unknown to even the wisest of sages. Since it has no use for its physical body at this point, the lich leaves it to decay as it should have done centuries ago.
    If the final resting place of a demilich's remains are entered, the dust which was once its body will rise up and assume a man-like shape. In the case of the oldest demiliches (25%), the shape will advance and threaten, but dissipate without attacking in 3 rounds unless attacked. Younger demiliches (75%) still retain a link to their remains, however, and will form with the powers of a wraith. This dust form cannot be turned. In addition, it can store energy from attacks and use this power to engage its foes. If the dust form is attacked, each point of damage which is delivered to it is converted to an energy point. Since the demilich will fall back and seem to suffer injury from each attack (though none is actually inflicted), its attackers are likely to press on in their attempts to destroy it. Once the demilich has acquired 50 energy points, it will assume a manifestation which looks much like the lich's earlier undead form and has the powers and abilities of a ghost, but which cannot be turned.
    If anyone touches the skull it will rise into the air and turn to face the most powerful of the intruders (a spell user will be chosen over a non-spell user). Instantly, it unleashes a howl which acts as a death ray , affecting all creatures within a 20' radius of the skull. Those who fail to save vs. death are permanently dead.
    On the next round, the demilich will employ another manner of attack. In order to attain the status of a demilich, a lich must have replaced 5-8 (1d4+4) of its teeth with gems. Each of these gems now serves as a powerful magical device which can trap the soul of its adversaries. The physical body of someone hit with the demilich's spell collapses and rots away in a single round. Once it has drained the life essence from the most powerful member of the party, the skull sinks back to the floor. If it continues to be challenged, the demilich can repeat this attack until all of its gems are filled. An amulet of life protectio will prevail over the gem, but the character's body will perish regardless.
    In addition to the attacks mentioned above, a demilich can also pronounce a powerful curse on those who disturb it. These can be so mighty as to include: always being hit by one's enemies, never making a saving throw, or the inability to acquire new experience points. Demilich curses can be overcome with a remove curse , but the victim loses one point of Charisma permanently when the curse is removed.
    The skull of a demilich is Armor Class -6 and has 50 hit points. It can be affected by spells in only a few ways: a forget spell will cause it to sink down without attacking (either by howling or draining a soul), a dispel evil will do 5-8 (1d4+4) points of damage to it, a shatter spell will inflict 3-18 (3d6) points of damage to it, a holy word pronounced against it will deliver 5-30 (5d6) points of damage, and a power word kill spell cast by an ethereal or astral wizard will cause the skull to shatter (destroying it).
    Most weapons will be unable to harm the skull of a demilich, but there are exceptions. A fighter or ranger with a vorpal sword , sword of sharpness , sword +5 , or vorpal weapon can inflict normal damage on the skull, as can a paladin with a vorpal or +4 weapon. Further, any character with a +4 or better weapon or a mace of disruptio can inflict 1 point of damage to the skull each time he strikes it.
    Upon the destruction of the skull, those who have been trapped inside the gems must make a saving throw vs. spell. Those who fail are lost forever, having been consumed by the demilich to power its magical nature. If the character survives, the gem glows with a faint inner light, and true seeing will reveal a tiny figure trapped within. If the throw is made the soul can be freed by simply crushing the gem. A new body must be within 10 yards for the soul to enter or it will be lost. Such a body might be a clone or simulacrum. (See spells of those names.)
    If the fragments of the destroyed skull are not destroyed by immersion in holy water and the casting of a dispel magic the demilich will reform in 1-10 days.
  Archlich: |
    From time to time, sages have heard rumors of liches having alignments other than evil, and even lawful good liches apparently have existed. There have even been reports of priests who, in extreme circumstances, have become liches. These reports have recently been verified, but the archlich is as rare as roc's teeth.

  Description: |
    The lumineaux are vast, diaphanous creatures that inhabit the flow. Some sages liken them to the giant mantas of earthly seas. To others, they are like white cells gliding through the lifeblood of the cosmos, filtering potential impurities.
    Lumineaux seek out portals to the crystal sphere , and then wrap themselves over the shell like a patch on a ball. They are virtually invisible to spacefarers. Phlogiston within their cells creates a rainbow-colored camouflage for their semitransparent body.
  Combat: |
    Lumineaux feed on memories. They actively channel life forms through a convoluted series of permeable membranes, slowly draining away levels of experience. The drain is only temporary, but among the uninitiated, it can prompt hasty and foolish responses.
    To extract memories, a lumineaux appears to create a kind of telepathic link with any intelligent life form passing through its body. When fixed on an intriguing memory, the lumineaux deadens that portion of the mind and "copies" the information. As a result, the victim loses 1 experience level per turn of drain. The victim may sense some confusion, but it must roll a successful Wisdom check to realize that memories and experience are waning. Of course, spellcasters whose levels are dropping may notice more immediate results when they find their available spells reduced in accordance with their loss in level. Other penalties to abilities that are based on experience level also apply. The lumineaux usually does not intend to kill its captives, and it drains them to a minimum of 1 level.
    Lumineaux can absorb travelers who are entering or leaving a crystal sphere. Normal passage through the creature lasts 2d4+2 turns. The speed or size of the ship is not a factor. The ship is reduced to combat speed and can perform combat maneuvers, but such maneuvers have little effect on the duration of the trip through the creature's strange digestive tract. Only one maneuver alters the trip: in full reverse, a ship with an SR above 6 can effectively stall itself. As the ship nears the lumineaux's outer membrane, the creature forcefully expels it.
    Just as humans are mostly water, lumineaux consist mainly of the phlogisto 's mysterious, flammable ether. As a result, any incendiary attack, magical or otherwise, has the same fiery effect as such assaults have in the phlogiston itself.
    Attempts to form a spiritual link with the creature are also dangerous. Any attempt to read the creature's mind or detect its alignment calls for a saving throw vs. paralyzation (at the character's current level). A failed saving throw means the character is overwhelmed by the barrage of thoughts, and he suffers 2d10 points of damage.
    Other spells and attacks work normally against the lumineaux. The best defense, however, may be no defense. The drain in experience level is only temporary; levels return at the rate of 1 per day as soon as the ship leaves the lumineaux.
    More dangerous than the lumineaux itself are the scavengers that may lie in waiting in the phlogiston, hoping for easy, low-level prey. A crew with scavvers traveling in its air pocket has similar cause for worry. Scavvers are not intelligent enough to be weakened by the lumineaux's attention. Larger scavvers, which are aggressive, may attack the ship when its crew is most vulnerable.
    If viciously attacked, a lumineaux tries to consume its attacker repeatedly, draining experience levels until its attacker no longer poses a threat. If that means killing its opponent, so be it.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Not much is known about the lumineaux. They are even rarer than the portals they guard. Sages who believe that greater divine forces govern the known gods offer the most plausible concept. They propose that the ultimate celestial powers may use the lumineaux as sentries, whose purpose is to monitor the activities within a crystal sphere.
    Nearly every encounter with a lumineaux to date has involved a solitary creature. Occasionally, however, two have been known to guard a portal. Sages suggest that such junctions indicate a definite mating cycle.
  Ecology: |
    Because their cells are filled with phlogiston, lumineaux are found only in the flow.

  Description: |
    In their true forms, the malicious lutums appear to be amorphous beings of tan, gelatinous clay that move by rolling. They fashion limbs for themselves as needed to aid in locomotion or combat. Lutums are able to sculpt themselves into bipedal and quadrupedal forms; with few exceptions they choose humanoid female shapes. Most lutums prefer these forms to their own.
    Furthermore, because all lutums have an innate ability to cast alter self four times a day, with a duration of four hours for each spell, they can so closely resemble female humans , half-elves , and elves , including drow , that others cannot tell their true nature. These women appear nearly perfect in form and have beautiful, striking features. The lutums have learned that imitating attractive women â€“ rather than plain ones or males â€“ helps them further their goals. Because of their other spell-like abilities, many pose as wizards or druids.
    Some lutums prefer to take on the images of existing humans and demihumans. This enables them to be automatically accepted in certain circles, and their behavior usually causes much embarrassment for the people they mimic.
  Combat: |
    In humanoid form, lutums posing as spellcasters usually attack with their spell-like abilities and magical items first. If they are forced to melee, they prefer to attack with weapons, further adding to the ruse that they are humans or demihumans. However, if pressed or if their true forms are revealed, lutums attack with two clay-like arms and with their large maws. If a victim is struck with all three of these attacks, he is considered caught in the gelatinous clay mass and will smother in 1d4+1 rounds.
    All lutums are able to cast the following spells: alter self four times a day, ESP twice a day, and friends , stoneskin , passwall , stoneshape , and clairaudience once a day.
    A common combat tactic of a lutum is to lure a male victim close by using its feminine charms, cast friends to keep him off guard, and then attack with surprise in an attempt to smother him. If the lutum is planetside, it uses stoneshape to catch the victim, and then pummels him to death. Its passwall ability is usually held in the event it needs to escape. In addition, one out of ten lutums can study magic and rise to the status of a 4th-level wizard.
    Lutums are immune to transmute rock to mud , stone to flesh , and both spells' reverse. They suffer full damage from blunt weapons, but only half damage from edged weapons. An earthquake spell instantly kills lutums, and a move earth spell incapacitates them for 1d6 turns.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Lutums prefer to act on their own. Their greed is so overpowering that they would rather not share anything with others of their kind. However, some lutums have learned that when they combine forces they can gain more power and wealth. In such lutum clans there is always a leader, usually the largest lutum.
    Lutums desire to gather the most magic and wealth possible, and to do so by assimilating themselves into human and demihuman societies. Lutums especially love magic that enables them to retain their human and demihuman forms longer.
    Lutums are also power-hungry. Some have been known to rise to important positions in human and demihuman governments by marrying the leaders, killing them, and then inheriting control, or simply by marrying the leaders and pulling their strings. In democratic societies, lutums prefer to rise to power on their own merits, campaigning for office and frequently winning because of their beauty, poise, and ruthlessness.
    Lutums enjoy traveling from planet to planet, acquiring power and wealth. They usually find passage on ships by appearing as beautiful women in dire need of transportation. A few lutums who have used their charms on the crew have been taught how to operate the ships, and they have subsequently taken them over.
  Ecology: |
    The origin of lutums is a mystery. Some believe a mad wizard experimenting with earth elementals gave them life. Others think that they are a variety of mimic from the plane of Ooze. Lutums must eat rocks, minerals, and a variety of clay compounds to gain nourishment.
    Lutums are asexual. They reproduce by splitting in half, but only when they feel a need to increase the power of their race; this usually occurs when one or more lutums in a clan die. The new lutums are born as adults with full abilities.

maedar:
  Summary:
    The maedar is a creature that most commonly associates with kobolds and orcs in the Spelljammer campaign setting.
  Stats:
  Description: |
    Maedar are male counterparts to medusae, though they lack the petrifying gaze of the females.
    The typical maedar is a muscular, hairless humanoid male, usually dressed in a kilt or tunic.
  Combat: |
    Maedar attack with powerful fists that each cause 2d4 points of damage. Once every three turns, the maedar can turn stone to flesh by touch. Maedar can pass through stone at their normal movement rate. They require one round of concentration before this; no other activity can be undertaken that round. Maedar struck by a phase door spell while passing through stone are killed instantly.
    Maedar are immune to petrifaction and paralyzation (including related spells, such as hold and slow ). They are immune to the poisonous bite of a medusa's serpentine hair. In addition, maedar can see into and extend their stone into flesh power into the Astral and Ethereal planes.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Maedar are the little-known male version of the medusae. They are extremely rare, however (far more rare than the frequency would indicate), and few medusae ever find a maedar spouse.
    Most medusae typically mate with huma males. This cross produces two to six eggs that hatch into fledgling, human-like females, who mature into medusae. The cross insures the continuation of the medusae species.
    When a medusa finds and mates with the extremely rare maedar, the eggs hatch into human infants, 25% male and 75% female. Only 1% of the males born of these matings are actually maedar; the remaining males and all the females are normal human infants who die at the sight of their mother.
    The typical maedar is a monogamist who mates for life; he is fiercely devoted to his mate and will go to any length to assist or avenge her. A widowed maedar will pursue his mate's killer for years.
    Because of the maedar's rarity and natural reclusiveness, even most sages are unaware of their existence. Maedar are rarely seen; generally they remain in the lair they share with a medusa mate. A maedar's magical power provides food for him and his mate. He smashes her petrified victims, then transforms them into meat.
  Ecology: |
    Maedar may cooperate with lawful evil creatures, such as kobolds and orcs, in exchange for security or reward. If forced to aid another creature, maedar seek revenge at the first opportunity.
  Glyptar: |
    Glyptars are rock crystals animated by the spirits of maedar. When a maedar has foreknowledge of his death, he can transfer his life force into the rocks. An extremely evil maedar retains his consciousness as it drifts through the ground. When such a life force encounters gemstones, such as feldspar or amethyst, it is trapped within and cannot leave voluntarily. Eventually the maedar goes mad. (Note that once a maedar is trapped within a glyptar crystal, his life force cannot be trapped in a second crystal.)
    If this glyptar is removed intact from the ground, the maedar's spirit is now able to animate the crystal and anything inorganic attached to it. Thus if the glyptar is set in the eye of a stone statue, the maedar's life force animates it as a golem. This can affect a maximum of 1,000 pounds.
    Similarly, if the glyptar is set in the pommel of a sword, the sword can be animated to strike as though it were wielded by the living maedar. The weapon gains a +1 bonus to its attack roll, strikes as if it were wielded by a 6th-level fighter, and gains a +2 bonus to its damage roll. Note that the glyptar's stone to flesh power enables the weapon to sink harmlessly into stone as the glyptar uses its power.
    The glyptar retains its other powers as well. The glyptar and its attachments may pass through stone at will at the normal movement rate. It is immune to phase door spells. Once every three turns the glyptar can perform a stone to flesh attack against a target touched by the glyptar or its setting. Glyptars remain immune to paralyzation and petrification attacks of all sorts.

  Description: |
    The master lich is a variation of the standard lich developed from a combination of incantations, potions, and promises made to dark, extradimensional powers. An undead creature becomes a master lich until such time as it must pay the price of the promises given to the dark powers.
    The master lich resembles a normal lich in many ways, save that its flesh is not rotted. Rather, the body is dessicated, the skin pulled back like leather over the skull and bones. It retains the standard lich's deepset, black eye sockets, with burning white pinpoints of light dancing deep within the recesses.
  Combat: |
    A master lich will not enter into direct combat unless he has no other choice or unless his target is helpless and easy to slay. If he chooses to avoid physical combat, he uses his ability to animate the dead to create an army of undead skeletons and zombies to fight in his stead.
    The undead are under the master lich's full control, and all their actions can be manipulated by the lich. He can see through the remains of their eyes and hear through the remnants of their ears. Any living creature killed by or through the master lich's hand can be reanimated in this fashion.
    In addition to retaining the abilities gained when alive, the master lich can paralyze on touch. Those failing a saving throw versus paralyzation will be immobile for 4-24 rounds.
    The master lich cannot be affected by enchantment/charm or necromantic spells, including those that allow others to control the undead. He is also unaffected by polymorph, poison, cold, insanity, and electricity magic. The master lich can be turned, however, except when he is on his home grounds; treat this lich as a special undead for purposes of turning. (The home grounds of the master lich known as the Fool are located in the warrens of the Spelljammer , and he is the only known example of a master lich. However, given the vastness of space , there is no telling whether another master lich may already be created - or when another may occur.)
    Unlike normal liches, the mere appearance of a master lich does not cause fear, and he may be struck with normal weapons. The master lich does regenerate 1 point/round and will do so even if the body is destroyed and separated. As such, he is truly undead.
    This lich is not restricted to humans and humanoids when creating undead. Long-dead creatures become skeletons, humans and humanoids become zombies, and all other large creatures become monster zombies. In addition to his regular zombies and skeletons, the Fool has created a pack of undead rats (1 HP, AC 9, MOVE 6, all other stats as per normal rats). These rats serve as his eyes, scouting the warrens for potential targets or enemies.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The master lich is not as solitary as are his lichling counterparts. Rather, he prefers to be at the apex of an undead society, typically of his own creation. He commands his skeletons and zombies without question and imposes his will on other undead through the force of his personality or through threat if need be. Any type of less-powerful undead may be under the command of a master lich, excepting only liches, archliches , and demiliches . Vampires and other sentient undead will be treated as uneasy allies at best.
    Since the master lich exists in part because of his eluding some dark bargain, he seeks safety in numbers. In particular he seeks protection from those who might seek to take the master lich to his final death.
  Ecology: |
    The master lich is undead, and with his regenerative properties can survive until he falls under the one true death. This will only happen if either of two events occur: if a dark power shows up to collect the lich's immortal spirit in payment, or if the lich is captured and dragged to a power's home plane. The master lich fears the dark powers that helped make him more than anything else in the world, for they are the ones who will prove to be his undoing.
    Occasionally a master lich will fixate on a particular place, event, or person, and he will work to the best of his undeadly ability to control that place, event, or person. This becomes an overriding obsession with the master lich, eventually negating all other needs.

  Description: |
    The mercurial slime is widely feared by wildspace sailors as a mindless, swift, and deadly organism.
    A colony of mercurial slime resembles a large blob of silver liquid drifting aimlessly in space. Several colonies can be found together, though no closer than 30' apart. As a result, only one colony at a time attacks a ship, though other mercurial slimes may block escape routes.
    Mercurial slime has no sensory organs, but it can follow sound waves to their source. It is also attracted to light. When the slime is in an atmosphere, it can sense motion by disturbances in the air.
  Combat: |
    Mercurial slime is pervaded with strong acid that works much like blood and digestive fluids do in a huma , dissolving nutrients and carrying them to individual cells. If the acid contacts living flesh, it dissolves the skin, causing 5d10 damage. All inorganic matter must save vs. acid at a -2 penalty. Weapons that hit the slime must save before they roll damage. If a weapon fails, it dissolves, causing no damage.
    Mercurial slime is most hazardous when it contacts a spelljamming ship. Should a vessel touch mercurial slime, it must save vs. acid. If the ship fails, the mercurial slime makes a standard attack roll. Its acid damages the ship like a heavy ballista.
    Sometimes the slime's silver surface catches starlight and reflects it back in lovely color patterns. Anyone staring at this display is mesmerized as if by hypnotic pattern cast at 4th level. Nothing frees the mesmerized viewer except a violent shaking for one round.
    Mercurial slime is not organic. Thus it cannot be affected by spells that control nature, such as charm plant or charm animal . Fire, cold, and electrical attacks have no effect. However, mercurial slime is susceptible to magic missile spells.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Mercurial slime is unintelligent and has no society or organization beyond the colony. It merely drifts through space, seeking to feed. It cannot communicate.
  Ecology: |
    The organism reproduces by fission while it is dissolving living tissue. There is a straight 1% chance that the slime reproduces after each hit against an organic target. The slime splits into two creatures, the victim takes an extra 5d10 damage, and the two creatures reach full size instantly.
    Mercurial slime converts light, including starlight, into propulsive energy. It can attain spelljamming speeds. Mercurial slime does not need air to survive, but it cannot land on planets , since gravity breaks it up into a fine mist which dissolves rapidly into nothing.
    Enterprising folk have attempted to use the slime as an organic spelljamming source. The big problem with this plan: The mercurial slime attacks any container holding it, requiring a saving throw at -2 (cumulative) vs. acid each round.
    Alchemists have tried in vain to collect mercurial slime to create a powerful acid, but the stuff keeps eating through vials and containers.
    Some sages theorize that mercurial slime is in fact nothing more than a groundling slime or jelly carried into space and somehow altered. Others call it a plague sent by deities who do not wish to see the races ply the spacelanes. It is interesting (and reassuring) that no clerics endorse this theory. Some elve scholars guess that mercurial slime may be a weapon from the Unhuman Wars.

  Description: |
    For as long as the huma race has been in space , sages have wondered what creates meteors. The meteorspawn is not necessarily the only source, but its presence certainly explains the reason for some of these flying rocks.
    Meteorspawn are huge globes of living rock. The smallest meteorspawn measures at least 100' in diameter; some specimens are rumored to reach diameters of thousands of feet. The meteorspawn has a circular mouth that measures Â¼ the spawn's diameter. Two other holes lie opposite each other on the left and right rear quarters. These holes, waste orifices, are no wider than one tenth the spawn's diameter. The meteorspawn's coloration ranges from black to earth brown to slate gray.
    Despite its great size and big mouth, the meteorspawn has no interest in eating spelljamming sailors nor their vessels. It drifts placidly, eating rocks and minerals.
  Combat: |
    Meteorspawn avoid fighting until they have lost 25% of their total hit points. Only this much damage makes the thick-skinned, unintelligent meteorspawn realize it is under attack.
    The meteorspawn's only real attack is the meteors that it shoots out of its two opposing holes at extremely high speeds. If the meteorspawn is less than 1,000' in diameter it can rotate its body and bring both holes to bear on an enemy. Meteorspawn wider than 1,000' can only bring one hole to bear.
    Any unfortunate caught in the line of fire gets hit by 1d4 meteors, each doing 3d10 damage. In ship combat, treat the meteors as heavy catapult shots. Whether or not a meteor hits, the shot flies out of the combat into wildspace. Another meteor is born!
    The meteorspawn's mouth does not bite, though if a ship collides with the mouth, it gets sucked in. The ship must make a saving throw vs. spell, or the part of the ship stuck in the meteorspawn's mouth is destroyed as though by a disintegrate spell. The ship's bow is normally the part which ends up colliding with the mouth. Each sailor in the affected area must make also save or suffer disintegration.
    Waste material in the form of boulders is stored in two sacs deep behind the mouth. When these sacs are filled, the meteorspawn shoots boulders of waste rock out into space at great pressure and speed.
    In rare (5%) instances, meteorspawns get close enough to planets to pull some atmosphere along with it. Since the meteorspawn does not need air to survive, this atmosphere remains until it is taken by grateful spelljammers.
  Ecology: |
    Most meteorspawn live for several centuries. During this time, the meteorspawn gestates 1d4 young. At the end of its life, it breaks up, and â€“ a rare and wondrous sight â€“ the young emerge. There is a 1% chance that any meteorspawn encountered is about to give birth.
    The initial size of the young depends on how many are born. If four are born, each is a quarter the size of the parent. If three are born, each is a third the size, and so on.
    Meteorspawn are a mixed blessing. On one hand, they clear away loose rock and debris that poses a navigational hazard. On the other hand, they create new hazards, high-velocity meteors that crash through ships. The only consolation is that the meteorspawns create less matter than they consume, so at least the overall volume of rocks and minerals in a given area is reduced.
    Some mariners consider the birth of a meteorspawn to be a sign of good luck, seeing the symbolism of renewed life from death. In addition, when the parent breaks up, sailors can retrieve enough ammunition for 2d10 shots for each catapult on board. The size of the catapult does not matter; there are plenty of rocks of all sizes to choose from!

  Description: |
    When a party encounters a pack of misi, always roll 1d6 to determine the number present, as the number of misi encountered may have a serious effect on any combat that follows.
    Misi do not exist in three of the four dimensions that humans and humanoids are capable of sensing. They have no physical manifestations in terms of length, width, or height. Instead, they exist solely in the fourth through sixth dimensions. Consequently, they cannot be injured by any form of physical attack, although they can be contacted and affected by magic.
    Occasionally, misi can be glimpsed in the spacial dimensions as rainbow-colored scintillations of indistinct shape, but for no more than a few moments at a time. Such appearances can occur anyplace â€“ on the surface of a planet , in the depths of wildspace , or even out on the phlogisto ocean. However, misi are almost always seen near spelljammer ships, for they are attracted to the magical emanations associated with the spacefaring craft.
  Combat: |
    The misi have no direct means of inflicting physical injury on ordinary beings. Instead, the misi rely on an indirect method to defend themselves â€“ interfering with any magic being used at the time, especially magic powering the spelljammer ships.
    When the misi attack, they always do so as a group, making a single attack no matter how many of them are involved. Their attack comes in one of two forms: They either interfere with spelljammer navigation, or they try to alter any spell being cast at the time. In either case, to see if the misi's attack is successful, roll an Intelligence check for the character casting the spell or using the spelljammer helm . If the user/wearer passes the check, he has repelled the misi attack. Otherwise, the misi are successful. To determine the results of a successful mist attack, consult the following table in the next column.
    The misi cannot be injured by any sort of physical attack, including those made with magical weapons. They are vulnerable only to damage from spells, and then only if an individual misi can be located to have the spell cast at it.
    Characters attempting to locate a misi have a percentage chance equal to three times their Intelligence score of spotting a misi's scintillating body for one round. For example, a character with an Intelligence score of 10 has a 30% chance of spying a misi, and a character with a Intelligence of 18 has a 54% chance. Misi cannot be detected by means of a detect invisible spell, but they can be located by use of a locate animal , locate object , or ESP spell.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Misi live in small family grottos in the fourth, fifth, and sixth dimensions. They cannot see into the first three dimensions any better than the PCs can see into the fourth, fifth, and sixth. They are aware of PCs only as vague shadows. They have absolutely no interest in characters inhabiting the first three dimensions, save when those characters are using magic.
  Ecology: |
    Misi feed on magical emanations and are therefore attracted to spelljamming ships. When misi attach themselves to a ship, they flit about the rudder, rigging, and decks, occasionally becoming visible as scintillating manifestations of light. They feed for 1d10 turns. During this time, the spelljammer's SR is reduced by 1 per round (that's right, per round!) of feeding. When the SR drops below 1, the ship drops out of spelljamming speed and is stranded until the misi finish feeding.

  Description: |
    The monitors are benevolent beings who patrol the farflung reaches of wildspace and the phlogisto . However, space is quite large, and the monitors' forces are spread thin. Understandably, not everyone feels comfortable around monitors. Their absolute, black-and-white code alarms beings who compromise or bend rules to accomplish things.
    Monitors manifest in two different ways. In a crystal sphere or on the Outer Planes, they appear as gold-skinned, winged centaurs. Their eyes and hair blaze as if made of red flames. In the phlogiston (only), monitors appear as silver-skinned pegasi, with icy blue eyes and manes. Both forms have the same movement rate.
    Monitors speak their own complex language, Common, and all of the tongues of evil races native to wildspace and the phlogiston.
  Combat: |
    Monitors are not averse to combat when necessary, though they usually give opponents a chance to surrender before starting hostilities.
    In their centaur form, monitors wield two-handed flame tongue swords. The swords strike twice per round, inflicting 1d10 hp on small or man-sized opponents, and 3d6 hp on larger opponents. Flame tongues are +1 swords, +2 vs. regenerating monsters, +3 vs cold-using, flammable, or avian creatures, and +4 vs. undead . Monitors have Strength 17.
    In pegasus form, monitors can breathe a cone of cold three times a day at 10th-level ability.
    In addition, either of the monitor's forms may strike with the two forehooves, doing 1d8 damage each. This, however, is a lastditch measure, as the monitors consider it undignified. Besides their normal magic resistance, monitors are immune to all spells from the school of enchantment/charm.
    A monitor reduced to 0 hp falls and dies in 1d4+1 rounds. Before the monitor expires, it makes a loud keening noise. This special distress call relays who is dying, where they fell, and the descriptions of those who committed the deed. Any monitors in the same crystal sphere immediately receive the report. Satisfied, the monitor dies, its body and sword becoming a puff of golden smoke.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Monitors travel in patrols with a rotating leader, giving all squad members the chance to command. The squads wander everywhere, enforcing the tenets of their lawful good alignment: punishing evil, rescuing the helpless, and protecting all innocent life from harm or malice. They personify goodness, raising the alignment of lawful good almost to an art. Monitors are unselfish, just, brave, unswervingly loyal to their ethos, and dedicated to their mission of eradicating or reforming evil. They are not intimidated by anything and calmly face overwhelming odds. One tale tells of a monitor who was surrounded and outnumbered by a horde of Pirates of Gith . When asked for her last words, the monitor replied, "You are all charged with murder, piracy, and threatening a monitor. Surrender now, and things will go easy for you." The scary thing is, after the dust of battle settled, she had won.
    Unfortunately, monitors are not the greatest diplomats. They have a black-and-white view of right and wrong. Compromise is repellent. As they say, "Shades of gray may feature a bit of white, but they also harbor a bit of black." In some cases, monitors have rescued halfling thieves from the clutch of illithids , then turned the thieves over to the proper authorities for incarceration.
    With all the evil races such as the neogi , illithids, and beholders in wildspace, other races are reluctant to alienate a powerful race of good beings who try to stem the tide of evil. Monitors are the butt of many complaints, jokes, and grumblings, but people turn to them first when a great evil arises.
  Ecology: |
    Though monitors appear as beautiful male or female centaurs, they do not reproduce. Young monitors have never been seen. Some scholars guess that monitors are the spirits of deceased paladins, rewarded by various good deities with these powers and responsibilities. Some cynical observers believe the opposite: paladins who were not "good enough" have been stuck with the task of policing space.
    Monitors do not require air, food, or drink, though they sometimes eat food to make other beings feel at ease. Even so, they are strict vegetarians.

  Description: |
    Moon dragons are evil dragons that exclusively inhabit caves on moons . Like most dragons, they prize wealth and power. The coloration of moon dragons changes every 30 days, starting out as brilliant white. Slowly, what appears to be a large black shadow forms on the dragon's left side, and gradually moves across the beast until it is all black. This process takes 15 days, whereupon a small sliver of white appears on the left side and moves across the dragon until, 15 days later, it is all white again. The dragonâ€™s strength and alignment vary with its coloration. Each "phase" lasts seven days. When the dragon is all black, it is at full strength and chaotic evil. When either black-white or white-black, its powers and combat modifiers are half the dragon's age category, its alignment neutral evil. When all white, it is lawful evil and its power is one quarter of its age category (e.g., an old dragon during the all-white phase fights as a very young dragon). Size and Intelligence do not change. When the moon dragon is all white, lycanthropes immediately change into were-form and, unless they save vs. magic, obey the moon dragon's commands as though charmed.
    Moon dragons speak the tongue common to all evil dragons, and 20% of all hatchlings can speak with any living being, this chance increasing 5% per age category.
  Combat: |
    The moon dragon dislikes lowering itself to mere combat. If provoked, it leads with its breath weapon and hopes this attack panics the enemy. If the dragon's opponents dare not flee, the dragon breathes again, sometimes casting a spell or two "for variety's sake". Moon dragons dislike using their claws and bite (each 1d4), considering such brawling beneath them. Moon dragons breathe a cone of black frost 160' long, 40' wide at the base, and 10' wide at the dragon's mouth. Besides causing damage, the black frost hardens rapidly. Those who fail to save vs. breath weapon are encased in a tomb of black ice, with only enough air for 1d4+1 rounds. After that time, the victim suffocates. Breaking the ice from the inside requires the victim to make a Strength ability check at -2 (allowed once per round).
    Breaking the ice from outside requires 1d6 rounds of uninterrupted chipping. Magical fire melts the ice in 1d4-1 rounds. Excess magical fire damages the victim.
    Moon dragons are immune to cold. They have superior vision and are not affected by either light or darkness spells. As they age, moon dragons gain the following spell abilities, each usable three times a day:
    Young: light ; Juvenile: darkness, 25' radius ; Adult: continual light ; Old: Melf's minute meteors ; Very old: repulsio ; Venerable: reverse gravity.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Moon dragons have a strong feeling of superiority. Arrogant and elitist, moon dragons are obsessed with the moon motif and the dichotomy of light and darkness. Their treasure consists mainly of white or black pearls and diamonds, moonstones, and any coin called a "moon" by its society.
  Ecology: |
    The average moon dragon brood holds 1d4 eggs.
    Moon dragons eat almost anything, and they keep a well-stocked larder of frozen victims. Only rarely do they range about their moon for food. Moon dragons are the mortal enemies of sun dragons and attack them on sight.

  Description: |
    Mortiss are called the "termites of wildspace " though scholars draw a closer analogy to aquatic coral. Mortiss are a colony of wildspace worms that bore through vegetable and mineral matter. They are a hazard to the hulls of all spelljamming ships. The gravity planes and oppressive air envelopes of moons and worlds prove fatal to the worm after a month of continued exposure.
    Mortiss young are about two inches long, while adults may grow to a length of six feet. Mortiss are unsegmented roundworms with a dorsal and ventral rib. They are eyeless, sensing by smell and vibration. They have a collar of leathery tendrils ringing their head. In addition, they have a poisonous stinger on the top of their heads and can extrude two pairs of opposing jaws to latch onto and suck blood from prey.
  Combat: |
    Mortiss infestation may occur from a collision with egg casings, from bringing mortiss-infested artifacts on board, or from docking near a mortiss-infested asteroid or ship for several hours. Mortiss cause 1d3 points of hull damage per week, and they may also infest the upper decks and lower hold through the hulls. Burrow tubes begin to appear within three to four weeks, always on the side of the ship that receives the most light. As with termites, burrows weaken the decking and superstructure, causing breakthroughs when excessive weight is applied to the undermined deck. Mortiss infestations may be destroyed by fire; a cure disease spell destroys a 10'Ã—10' nest of mortiss.
    Mortiss attack any creatures that try to destroy their burrows. They may sting the invading creatures with their head spines, causing 1 point of damage per sting. Victims must roll successful saving throws vs. poison (with a -2 penalty) or suffer 1d6 additional points of damage and a delusional side effect. Deluded individuals start to see dangers as greater or lesser than they really are, or they may experience hallucinations of being elsewhere, shutting out reality altogether. Victims suffer the delusion for 1d6 hours. A deluded victim may roll Intelligence checks to disbelieve an aspect of his delusion each round, but he suffers a +1 penalty per poisoned sting suffered.
    Mortiss also may lunge at a victim and latch onto him with their jaws, draining 1 point per round. Up to six mortiss can attack for every five-foot-square area the intruders enter. Each mortiss has 1 Hit Die; the number of worms in the colony equals the total number of Hit Dice. A mortiss colony increases by 1d6 Hit Dice for every point of hull damage it causes.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Mortiss generally do not get along with other life. However, certain wildspace denizens seem to coexist with mortiss just fine, such as scavvers , krajens , kindori , and elmarins . Indeed, one effect of a mortiss colony is to replenish the air envelope. Thus wildspace denizens often lair among mortiss, waiting for prey to wander near.
    Mortiss have the magical ability to convert light energy into magic, enabling them to burrow through wood and rock as if it were soil. The digested material is converted into a clay that is used to construct coral castles atop their burrows. Early infestations of mortiss may go undetected, until the stone-like tubes appear on the hull. Left to their own, mortiss will encase a ship within a year with their constructions, destroying the hull. Scholars hypothesize that many asteroids, and perhaps even some smaller moons, may contain some hidden structure at their heart, thanks to the mortiss' endeavors.
    Mortiss are hermaphroditic and mutually fertilize each other's egg casings. Casings are then deposited on spelljammer hulls to hatch within a week of laying. Mortiss egg cases resemble geodes.
  Ecology: |
    Mortiss can burrow through wood and stone at a rate of one yard per turn. They must expose themselves to light for up to one hour before they can burrow for an equal amount of time. They cannot store more than one hour's worth of energy and must return to the surface after an hour of burrowing to soak up more light energy.
    A colony covers a five-foot-square area for every Hit Die. In addition, for every 4 Hit Dice, the colony erects one ten-foot-square castle to a height of 1d6 feet.
    Spelljammers should be warned to regularly check their hull, and periodically make landfalls of a month or more to rid their vessels of these parasites.

  Description: |
    Mummies are corpses native to dry desert areas, where the dead are entombed by a process known as mummification. When their tombs are disturbed, the corpses become animated into a weird unlife state, whose unholy hatred of life causes them to attack living things without mercy.
    Mummies are usually (but not always) clothed in rotting strips of linen. They stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and are supernaturally strong.
  Combat: |
    Mummies are horrific enemies. A single blow from one's arm inflicts 1-12 points of damage, and worse, its scabrous touch infects the victim with a rotting disease which is fatal in 1-6 months. For each month the rot progresses, the victim permanently loses 2 points of Charisma. The disease can be cured only with a cure disease spell. Cure wounds spells have no effect on a person inflicted with mummy rot and his wounds heal at 10% of the normal rate. A regenerate spell will restore damage but will not otherwise affect the course of the disease.
    The mere sight of a mummy causes such terror in any creature that a saving throw versus spell must be made or the victim becomes paralyzed with fright for 1 to 4 rounds. Numbers will bolster courage; for each six creatures present, the saving throw is improved by +1. Humans save against mummies at an additional +2.
    Mummies can be harmed only by magical weapons, which inflict only half damage (all fractions round down). Sleep , charm , hold , and cold-based spells have no effect. Poison and paralysis do not harm them. A resurrectio spell will turn the creature into a normal human (a fighter at 7th level ability) with the memories of its former life, or will have no effect if the mummy is older than the maximum age the priest can resurrect. A wish will also restore a mummy to human form but a remove curse will not.
    Mummies are vulnerable to fire, even nonmagical varieties. A blow with a torch inflicts 1-3 points of damage. A flask of burning oil inflicts 1-8 points of damage on the first round it hits and 2-16 on the second round. Magical fires are +1 damage/die. Vials of holy water inflict 2-8 points of damage per direct hit.
    Any creature killed by a mummy rots immediately and cannot be raised from death unless both a cure disease and a raise dead spell are cast within six rounds.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Mummies are the product of an embalming process used on wealthy and important personages. Most mummies are corpses without magical properties. On occasion, perhaps due to powerful evil magic or perhaps because the individual was so greedy in life that he refuses to give up his treasure, the spirit of the mummified person will not die, but taps into energy from the Positive Material plane and is transformed into an undead horror. Most mummies remain dormant until their treasure is taken, but then they become aroused and kill without mercy.
    A mummy lives in its ancient burial chamber, usually in the heart of a crypt or pyramid. The tomb is a complex series of chambers filled with relics (mostly nonmagical). These relics include models of the mummy's possessions, favorite items and treasures, the bodies of dead pets, and foodstuffs to feed the spirit after death. Particularly evil people will have slaves or family members slain when they die so the slaves can be buried with them. Because of their magical properties, mummies exist on both Prime and Positive Material planes.
  Ecology: |
    To create a mummy, a corpse should be soaked in a preserving solution (typically carbonate of soda) for several weeks and covered with spices and resins. Body organs, such as the heart, brain, and liver, are typically removed and sealed in jars. Sometimes gems are wrapped in the cloth (if the treasure listing for the mummy indicates it possesses gems, a few may be placed in the wrappings). Mummies are not part of the natural ecosystem and have no natural enemies.
    Mummy dust is a component for rotting and disease magical items.

  Description: |
    Murderoids, so named by travelers because of their aggressive, evil nature, are perhaps the largest denizens of space . These living asteroids are fierce rock creatures that possess their own gravity and atmosphere and move about systems in search of food. Their air envelope is 1d4 miles thick. They attack all creatures smaller than themselves.
    Most murderoids are 100 miles long, or longer, and their weight ranges from billions to trillions of tons. Murderoids have a coarse, rock-like skin that is several feet thick and ranges in color from dark brown to dark gray. Their sensory organs, similar to eyes and ears, appear as craters and small hills. They speak no language, but they are able to communicate their emotions to other murderoids by changing the color of their skin. Lighter shades represent satisfaction and pleasure; darker shades represent hunger and anger.
  Combat: |
    Murderoids can sense creatures up to 60,000 miles away. They attack by luring living creatures to land on their rocklike skin. Once a creature is on its surface, the murderoid uses spells and its physical attacks to prevent the creature from leaving.
    Each murderoid can cast grease , dig , hallucinatory terrain , stone shape , and earthquake , as a 14th-level spellcaster (though only three times a day). The range of the spell is the murderoid's surface and air envelope.
    Murderoids usually begin their assault by casting a special hallucinatory terrain spell to make their surfaces appear to be paradise.
    Once a ship or creature has landed, the murderoid casts stone shape to form a part of itself around the ship or creature to prevent its escape. Additional tactics include casting grease or dig spells so creatures cannot stand, or earthquake so ships are damaged. After its spell assault, the murderoid attacks physically by opening up a "mouth" on its surface and biting its victim. A murderoid can create up to three mouths in each one-square-mile area, and 12 mouths over its entire form. A mouth can sustain 30 points of damage before being destroyed. It takes 30 minutes to regenerate a mouth.
    Murderoids are immune to earthquake spells. However, move earth stuns a square-mile area of the creature for 1d6 rounds, and stone to flesh stuns a square-mile area for 1d4 turns.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Murderoids live to eat and continuously hunt for food. They consider all living things smaller than themselves fair game. They have no established territory, forever wandering space in search of food.
    Murderoids are solitary creatures; only in extremely rare circumstances is a group encountered. Such groups contain juvenile murderoids, each of which is less than 50 miles long. From an early age, murderoids learn that status is important. And status is usually measured by the number of ships a murderoid has gathered. While the bulk of a captured ship is consumed, a murderoid usually leaves a section of the ship on its skin to display to any passing murderoids. The oldest murderoids usually have the most trophies. Unfortunate spacefarers have discovered that occasionally the section of a ship which is being used as a trophy transmits a distress beacon; this beacon lures yet more spacefarers to their doom. Such beacons include flashing lights or magical items that transmit light or energy.
    Murderoids mate once every 50 years. A mating results in one egg, which is laid on a small asteroid. The infant murderoid eats the asteroid and takes its place â€“ much to the chagrin of space travelers who thought that body to be a lifeless rock. In infant stage, the murderoid is a 10-Hit Die creature and can generate only three mouths over its entire body. Infant stage lasts five years, then the creature is considered a 50-Hit Die adult.
    Murderoids live to be about 6,000 years old, generally growing at a rate of one mile in diameter for every 100 years.
  Ecology: |
    Murderoids' favorite food are kindori and radiant dragons . Their natural enemies are spacefaring dwarves . Evil humanoids have been known to hunt infant murderoids, which they attempt to charm for their own malign purposes.
    The skin of a murderoid can be used as spell components for stone shape and hallucinatory terrain spells.

  Description: |
    The nay-churr (the name is singular and plural) are members of a very rare and widely dispersed species whose origin is lost in antiquity. These creatures ply the swirling eddies of the phlogisto , although they are occasionally found inside a crystal sphere . They can exist in any environment.
    Body types vary slightly, but all nay-churr have certain physical properties in common. The dominant feature of the body is a rockhard â€“ but still flexible â€“ stomach in the shape of a tapered cylinder when it is empty. At the end of the creature is a mouth-like opening (called the maw) that is roughly the shape of an oblong rectangle when at rest. When the creature is feeding, the maw expands to several times its normal size; in the largest varieties, the maw can be as much as 500 feet in diameter.
    Differences in size (and Hit Dice) run roughly according to this pattern:
  Combat: |
    The nay-churr does not engage in combat per se; it is virtually mindless and doesnâ€™t know anything about attacking. (A normal attack roll still applies, to see if the creature hits anything it comes into contact with.) However, it can certainly be dangerous to travelers.
    The nay-churr spends its lifetime cruising through whatever environment it occupies, taking in any object or substance it happens to run across, as long as the object is small enough to fit in its maw. The object is not damaged by being swallowed: characters and ships â€“ to name two examples of things that can be swallowed â€“ can be carried around inside the creatureâ€™s stomach for an indefinite length of time and then disgorged intact and unharmed. The creature's treasure consists of whatever it happens to be carrying around at the time, ranging from rocks and wreckage to undamaged and still useful items â€“ up to and including entire ships.
    The most effective way to fight a nay-churr is to simply avoid it; fortunately, because the creature moves very slowly and is very poor at changing direction, this is generally pretty easy to do. If combat is desirable or necessary (for instance, if a disabled companion is trapped inside the nay-churr), then the best approach is to strike at the sensitive area around the maw. If a nay-churr is reduced to 0 hit points by a series of hits on its maw, it immediately expels the contents of its stomach and becomes inert, neither moving nor swallowing, for a period of up to several weeks.
    A nay-churr attacked in this fashion is not dead. The only way to kill the creature is to strike exclusively at the stomach until it is reduced to 0 hit points â€“ whereupon the stomach explodes 1d6 rounds later, killing the nay-churr but also causing 10d10 points of damage to anyone or anything inside it and 5d10 points of damage to anything else within 200 feet. (From the standpoint of someone inside the creature, this sort of cure be worse than the disease.)
    Trying to escape by hacking through the stomach from the inside can have disastrous consequences. If the inner wall of the stomach is damaged even slightly by an attack, the nay-churr will go immediately into a state of instinctive panic and convulsion â€“ moving forward at a rate of 18 and thrashing violently from side to side as it does so. Any objects or creatures inside it are thrown around with such force that further attacking is impossible, and the victims suffer 1d10 points of damage per round from impacts with other objects or debris.
    A nay-churr does voluntarily disgorge the contents of its stomach on occasion: whenever the creature happens to be inside the air envelope of some object that it isn't capable of swallowing, such as a planet or a large ship (100 tons or more). The result is a rain of debris in the direction of the gravity plane of the planet or ship.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Nay-churr are native to the phlogiston, and this is where they are the happiest (if such a term can be used). There they can cruise endlessly, sucking up a never-ending and never-filling supply of the ether. However, they have been known to drift into wildspace through a portal in a crystal sphere (nay-churr cannot penetrate a crystal sphere on their own).
  Ecology: |
    Aside from their mindless, chaotic propensity for swallowing anything they encounter, nay-churr play no part in the ecology of the multiverse. However, if a sufficiently large piece of the outer stomach wall of a nay-churr can be salvaged after an explosion, it can be formed into a breastplate that retains its Armour Class of -2.

neogi:
  Summary:
    Neogi are unusual creatures who usually look like a cross between a spider and an eel. They have a bloated body and eight limbs, two of which have simple claws, and are covered in light tan fur. [1]
    Neogi are slave traders and they consider everything either a slave or owner. All neogi have several slaves, usually umber hulks , sometimes even other neogi. These neogi slaves have more slaves, leading to complex ownership hierarchy. [1]
  Society: |
  Religion: |
    Powers of the neogi are referred to as "deity" and not "god" or "goddess" as there is no distinction between male or female amongst the sexless neogi. Deities are viewed as servants by the insolent neogi, who continually demand favor and good fortune.
    Neogi never pray, and rarely offer sacrifice, since they see themselves as more important.
    Pronouncing the name of a neogi deity incorrectly is an invitation to be killed slowly and painfully. Humans , who tend to find neogi pronunciation difficult, are advised not to attempt saying deities' names.
    The neogi pantheon includes:
    Ka'jk'zxl , the dead god of creation.
    Kil'lix , a chaotic evil lesser god of death, murder, and poison.
    Kr'tx , a chaotic evil lesser god of war, brutality, and strength.
    P'kk , a lawful evil lesser god of fear and tyranny.
    Thrig'ki , a neutral evil lesser god of "love" (actually more like envy and jealousy in human terms).
    T'zen'kil , a neutral evil lesser god of torture, pain, and suffering.
  History: |
    The neogi homeworld is referred to in their legends as Ka'jk'z . In the neogi creation myth, Ka'jk'z was the place where the brain of the neogi creator deity, Ka'jk'zxl, landed after he was killed by the lesser neogi gods. The neogi were apparently born from the brain of the deity. They simply abandoned their world after being informed by their gods of their destiny to conquer all the crystal spheres . [2]
    Drago #350 tells a different story, citing rumors that the neogi homeworld was the first to be destroyed by the clockwork horrors after the world of the Lost Ones . [3]
    Lords of Madness cites similar rumors, claiming that "some sages" believe the neogi homeworld no longer exists. [4]

  Description: |
    The neogi appear as a cross between a wolf spider and a moray eel. The short, furry, eight-limbed body is topped by a lithe, bare, fleshy neck with a serpentine head, its mouth filled with needle-sharp teeth. The ends of its limbs are tipped with small claws. The fur of the neogi is a light tan, but dyed a variety of colors to signify power, rank, accomplishments, and warnings to other neogi. The older a neogi grows, the more colorful its hide becomes.
    The neogi are ruthless slayers and plunderers, and think nothing of eating their enemies, servants, or fallen comrades. They are a hateful, xenophobic race.
    Neogi can communicate in their own language and in Common. Many speak 1-4 other languages to help facilitate their slaves taking orders correctly.
  Combat: |
    The neogi have a number of defenses, the first, and most obvious being their enslavement of umber hulks . Each neogi has a personal umber hulk slave who is a combination bodyguard, manservant, and useful set of hands. Second, the bite of the neogi is poisonous. Those bitten and failing a saving throw vs. poison are affected as by a slow spell for 1d8 rounds. Multiple bites will extend this period by an additional 1d8 rounds per bite. Lastly, 1 in 10 neogi has some magical ability, equal to huma spell use of levels 1-8.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The hated neogi are only found in very remote locations, deep beneath the earth, or among the farthest stars. Their lives revolve around their communities and their slaves. Neogi are a slaving race with an inborn sense of property: all is either owned or owner, slave or neogi. Even neogi are slaves to other neogi, but slave-neogi may have their own slaves. The neogi tattoo their non-neogi slaves with symbols of ownership, usually on the left shoulder in the front and back.
    Captive umber hulks are trained from birth to follow their "small lords", caring for their every need. Any neogi can command another umber hulk (the effect of this command is akin to the effect of the charm monster spell).
    The neogi world view of "own or be owned" has resulted in a paranoid outlook that borders on xenophobia, and their relentless attacks on other races result in their being universally hated. The only "normal" race with ties to neogi are the mind flayers , who make a profit on the neogi slave trade.
  Ecology: |
    As a neogi grows older and his mind fades, his orders become confused and his slaves become disobedient. His fellow neogi may choose to poison the older one at once. The different poisons moving through its body overload the old neogi's system, and it begins its change into a Great Old Master.
    The neogi making the transformation swells to 20 feet in height and a similar girth. Its legs and arms become useless, and its intelligence fades; it now lives only to eat. Live flesh is preferred, but the dead will sustain it. A Great Old Master inflicts 1d12 points of damage per round to any creature it is fed. After 2 months of eating, the skin of the Great Old Master bursts and a new crop of mature neogi spill forth. These are unmarked and barely sentient at birth, and for the next week the brood area resounds with combat as the young neogi kill each other for food. Of the 20-40 neogi that eat their way out, only about 3-6 survive. These are considered slaves of the community, until such a time as they claim an umber hulk as their personal slave.
    If a Great Old Master is attacked and its flesh pierced, it releases 2d4 neogi to defend itself. These are taken from the future brood, and are not replaced. Blunt weapons will not pierce the skin and therefore do not bring forth young. Edged or piercing weapons, or magical spells that pierce or burn, will produce this defensive reaction.
  Reaver: |
    These rogue neogi have rebelled and are seeking to escape the other neogi and their poisons that will transform them into Great Old Masters. Rogue neogi are little better than their fellows, and are, if anything, more desperate, due to being pursued by their former fellows, all eager to start the process of producing more neogi.

  Description: |
    Ogres are big, ugly, greedy humanoids that live by ambushes, raids, and theft. Ill-tempered and nasty, these monsters are often found serving as mercenaries in the ranks of orc tribes, evil clerics, or gnolls . They mingle freely with giants and trolls.
    Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 300 to 350 pounds. Their skin colors range from a dead yellow to a dull black-brown, and (rarely) a sickly violet. Their warty bumps are often of a different color â€“ or at least darker than their hides. Their eyes are purple with white pupils. Teeth and talons are orange or black. Ogres have long, greasy hair of blackish-blue to dull dark green. Their odor is repellent, reminiscent of curdled milk. Dressing in poorly cured furs and animal hides, they care for their weapons and armor only reasonably well. It is common for ogres to speak orc, troll, stone giant, and gnoll, as well as their own guttural language. A typical ogre's life span is 90 years.
  Combat: |
    In small numbers, ogres fight as unorganized individuals, but groups of 11 or more will have a leader, and groups of 16 or more usually include two leaders and a chieftain. Ogres wielding weapons get a Strength bonus of +2 to hit; leaders have +3, chieftains have +4. Females fight as males but score only 2-8 points of damage and have a maximum of only 6 hit points per die. Young ogres fight as goblins.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Ogre tribes are found anywhere, from deep caverns to mountaintops. Tribes have 16-20 males, 2-12 females, and 2-8 young. Shamans, if present, will be of 3rd level, and have access to the spheres of combat, divination, healing, protection, and sun (darkness only). Ogres live by raiding and scavenging and they will eat anything. Their fondness for elf , dwarf , and halfling flesh means that there is only a 10% chance that these will be found as slaves or prisoners. There is a 30% chance that an ogre lair will include 2-8 slaves. Captured prisoners are always kept as slaves (25%) or food (75%). Extremely avaricious, ogres squabble over treasure and cannot be trusted, even by their own kind.
  Ecology: |
    Ogres consistently plague mankind, lusting for gold, gems, and jewelry as well as huma flesh. They are evil-natured creatures that join with other monsters to prey on the weak and favor overwhelming odds to a fair fight. Ogres make no crafts nor labor.
  Ogre Leader: |
    When more than 11 ogres are encountered, a leader will be present. He is a 7 Hit Dice monster with 30-33 hit points and Armor Class 3. He inflicts 5-15 (2d6+3) points of damage per attack, +6 with weapon.
  Ogre Chieftai: |
    If 16 or more ogres are encountered, they will be led by two patrol leaders and a chieftain. The chieftain is a 7 Hit Dice monster with 34-37 hit points and Armor Class 4. He inflicts 8-18 (2d6+6) points of damage per attack, +6 with weapon. Chieftains are usually the biggest and smartest ogres in their tribes.
  Ogre Mage: |
  Description: |
    The oriental ogre has light blue, light green, or pale brown skin with ivory horns. The hair is usually a different color (blue with green, green with blue) and is darker in shade; the main exception to this coloration is found in ogre magi with pale brown skin and yellow hair. They have black nails and dark eyes with white pupils. The teeth and tusks are very white. Ogre magi are taller and more intelligent than their cousins and they dress in oriental clothing and armor.
  Combat: |
    Ogre magi can perform the following feats of magic: fly (for 12 turns), become invisible , cause darkness in a 10-foot radius, polymorph to a human or similar bipedal creature (4 feet to 12 feet tall), and regenerate one hit point per round (lost members must be reattached to regenerate). Once per day they can do the following: charm perso , sleep , assume gaseous form , and create a cone of cold 60 feet long with a terminal diameter of 20 feet, which inflicts 8-64 (8d8) points of damage (save vs. spell for half damage). Oriental ogres attack with magic first and resort to physical attacks only if necessary. They are +1 on morale.
    In battle, ogre magi prefer the naginata (75%) or scimitar and whip (25%). Those found in oriental settings might (25%) possess ki power or have mastered a martial arts form. As ogre magi are intelligent, they will not fight if faced with overwhelming odds, but will flee to gather their forces or hide.
  Habitat/Society: |
    These monsters live in fortified dwellings or caves and foray to capture slaves, treasure, and food. Ogre magi priests of up to 7th level have been reported. Tribes are small, with 2-5 females and 1-3 children that will not fight, but rather seek to escape in gaseous form. These monsters are extremely protective of their young and will battle with savage abandon to save one's life. If a young ogre mage is captured, these creatures will pay high ransom for its return, but they will seek revenge and will never forget the insult of the kidnapping.
    If encountered in their lair, ogre magi will be led by a chief of great strength (+2 on each Hit Die, attacking and saving as a 9 Hit Dice monster). Treasure is divided by this chief and his trove is always the richest. The tribe will have their own clan symbol typical to the oriental lands, and this symbol will be stitched on its war banners and flags as well as on armor and headdresses. The chief will often have the tribe's symbol tattooed on his forehead or back.
    Ogre magi speak the common tongue, their own special language, and the speech of normal ogres.
  Ecology: |
    Ogre magi magical armor is too large to fit a man. This monster's lair is usually a powerful structure that can be expanded into a mighty fortress if it can be rid of its original owners.
  Merrow (Aquatic Ogre): |
  Description: |
    Faster and fiercer than their land kin, the freshwater merrow are greenish and scaled with webbed hands and feet. Their necks are long and thick, their shoulders are sloping, and they have huge mouths and undershot jaws. Merrow have black teeth and nails and deep green eyes with white centers, and their hair resembles slimy seaweed. About 10% grow ivory horns, especially the more powerful males.
    Aquatic ogres are very fond of tattoos, and females may have their entire bodies inked with scenes of death and destruction as a sign of status. Merrow speak their own dialect and the language of other ogres.
  Combat: |
    Using their green coloration, aquatic ogres can hide, becoming effectively invisible 10-80% of the time, depending on terrain. They attack from cover, so others are -5 on their surprise roll. Merrow typically attack with a large piercing spear (inflicting 2-12 points of damage) in a swimming charge at +1 to hit, followed by melee with talons and teeth.
  Habitat/Society: |
    A typical merrow tribe consists of:
    1 chief, AC 3, 6+6 Hit Dice, +2 on damage
    2 patrol leaders, AC 3, 5+5 Hit Dice, +1 on damage
    2-24 standard merrow
    2-24 females, AC 5, 3+3 Hit Dice, 1-2/1-2/1-6 damage
    1-12 young, AC 6, 2+2 Hit Dice, 1-2/1-2/1-4 damage
    1 shaman of 3rd level ability
    Merrow dwell in caves in shallow, fresh water (50-250 feet deep), often with scrags (see Troll ). They can live out of water for about two hours, so they often forage on land. Merrow usually control an area with a radius of 10-15 miles, hunting and foraging throughout this territory. In times of scarcity, or when the lure of treasure becomes too great, a war party will attack the coastal villages of man. Merrow prefer gold and jewels and often overlook dull magical items in search of glittering prizes. The goals of a merrow chieftain rule the tribe, and these power-hungry monsters seek to completely control their "kingdoms", often leading to attacks on intruding ships.
  Ecology: |
    Merrow are ignorant and superstitious and have no skills but plundering and murder. Areas of the freshwater lakes and seas where they have influence are avoided by sailors and fishermen. These monsters are carnivores, preying on all who enter their regions, often emptying the seas of life with their voracious appetites.

  Description: |
    Ontalaks can produce a covering made of fibrous material that has the density of any material from brass to cloth. They have learned to make coverings of interest to those they feed upon.
    A common ontalak tactic in wildspace is to form the covering to resemble a wrecked ship. When spacefaring adventurers come along, they will often stop at the wrecked ship to investigate and plunder her. When the ontalak becomes aware of the presence of others, it waits until the ship gets close enough to attack or the crew boards it. It then attacks for the sole purpose of gaining food.
    Ontalaks enter a dormant state when not in combat. In this state an ontalak can last for years between feedings.
    Ontalaks can stretch their pseudopods to the limit of their air bubble. The smallest ontalak ever found had 16 Hit Dice and was the size of a wasp spelljammer; most specimens are larger.
    Ontalaks create a large ball that is kept in their interiors; when a heavy concentration of ontalak acid is poured onto it, it functions as a major spelljamming helm . Ontalaks can move overland like deGleash , but this is a relatively slow process due to the ontalaks' great size (movement of 3).
  Combat: |
    Ontalaks attack with giant pseudopods that come up out of the hatch, cracks in the deck, and other areas of the "ship" they form. These cause 2d10 points of damage each. The number of such pseudopods any given ontalak can create equals the average crew complement of the ship it is masquerading as. At best an ontalak can attack a single, man-sized opponent with only two of its pseudopods. These attacks are with a THAC0 of 10 because it sees its opponents via many tiny nerve endings scattered over its pseudopods like hair, resulting in a rather blurry picture.
    Any attack roll of a natural 20 by an ontalak means that it has grasped its opponent. In this case, roll 1d4 to determine what it will do with the victim:
    1. Retract the pseudopod and absorb the victim for digestion
    2. Toss into space
    3. Extend to edge of air envelope and drop victim (falling dmg)
    4. Smash victim into deck and opponents (2d10 dmg)
    An absorbed victim suffers 2d20 points of acid damage per round and escape is virtually impossible. Someone trapped within can attack with a dagger or smaller weapon if it is in hand.
    Ontalaks can also pump their digestive acid up through a special pseudopod that they always have ready. This pseudopod looks like a plunger and can fasten itself onto the hull of an enemy vessel. Once attached, it can cause 1d6 points of hull damage per round if it concentrates fully on the attack. Ontalaks often grab the ship with their other pseudopods and pull it closer.
    Most ontalak pseudopods are from one to three feet in diameter, thus they can be cut off only by a vorpal blade or a sword of sharpness . To stop any one pseudopod from functioning, the entire being must be killed. Ontalaks suffer no damage from piercing weapons, half damage form slashing weapons, and full damage from bludgeoning weapons. Fire-based attacks cause double damage. Cold-based attacks have no effect. As with all plasmoids , they are immune to poison and disease. They are also completely immune to acid.
    An ontalak's ship-like covering has the same statistics as a real ship of that type (hull points, SR = 2, NR = D, and saves as soft metal). Once the hull is destroyed, the ontalak retracts all pseudopods and covers itself in a thick excretion of tar-like acid (1d12 points of damage per round of contact). It also tries to spelljam away if possible. Note that all damage upon the fake hull is calculated normally, and this damage also affects the ontalak. However, such damage is adjusted as per the ontalak's plasmoidal properties ( ballistae do nothing to it, for example).
  Habitat/Society: |
    Ontalaks rarely encounter each other except for breeding purposes. Reports say that a huge armada of ghost ships gathers in deep wildspace once a year.
    Ontalaks can be found masquerading as other things, such as a wooden house in a forest, a ghost ship on the high seas, and occasionally a haunted house. Ontalaks sometimes re-absorb their covering and live in a real abandoned ship or dwelling.
  Ecology: |
    As with all plasmoids, ontalaks eat nearly anything they can digest. If an ontalak is killed, it releases an acid that causes damage to its covering equal to half its hull points.

  Description: |
    Oortlings are a pathetic race, dwelling on the natural comets that exist within the crystal spheres . While the oortlings once had a fairly sophisticated culture, they were dominated by the mind flayers early on in their evolution. Since that time, they have been manipulated and controlled by the spacefaring illithid and kept as "cattle."
    The typical oortling looks much like a dwarf , short, stocky, and noted for their pallor and bloated skulls. Within these skulls are the overdeveloped brains of the oortlings. Although kept from acquiring an education by their overlords, oortlings have the potential for great intelligence. As a rule, however, the best any oortling's brain can hope for is to be the main course at a mind flayer feast.
  Combat: |
    The oortlings have had all knowledge of combat bred out of them by the mind flayers. They cringe in fear from even the slightest possibility of violence. In cases where oortlings are in extreme pain or have lost their senses, they have been known to bite and scratch their opponents. While this attack is fairly feeble, it can inflict some minor damage (1d2 points).
  Habitat/Society: |
    Oortlings live on the flying mountains of ice and iron that men call comets, making their homes by tunneling through the frozen surface, eventually into the iron or stone nucleus of the comet. Their communities are usually fairly small by huma standards, with only 40-240 (4d6Ã—10) oortlings living on any given comet. Of this number, half are females and young.
    While oortling culture was once advanced enough to construct great palaces from the ice of their cometary homes, it has degenerated into a state of primitive tribalism. The main reason for this is the domination and domestication of the oortling people by the mind flayers. Even at the height of their culture, the oortlings had no chance of breaking free from the mental and physic bondage into which they were thrust by the illithids.
    Currently, the oortlings are a broken people. All creativity and curiosity has been crushed from their spirits, leaving them a ghastly race of "cattle," tended and guarded by a group of mind flayer "farmers" and then hauled away to sate the hunger of the illithids.
  Ecology: |
    Oortlings feed on the ice that makes up the comets on which they live. Their systems are able to break down the ice, extracting the vital nutrients from it and filtering out toxins that would kill other humanoids. Only cometary ice contains the chemicals they need to sustain themselves, however, and a diet of normal water ice does nothing to nourish them.
    Oortlings produce few useful byproducts or trade goods which other races might be interested in. The sole exception to this, of course, are the mind flayers who breed the oortlings as human races breed cattle. Some other cultures have found that the fluid around the oortling's brain is a useful component in the creation of many potions that deal with telepathy and other mental powers.

  Description: |
    Orcs are a species of aggressive mammalian carnivores that band together in tribes and survive by hunting and raiding. Orcs believe that in order to survive they must expand their territory, and so they are constantly involved in wars against many enemies: humans , elves , dwarves , goblins , and other orc tribes.
    Orcs vary widely in appearance, as they frequently crossbreed with other species. In general, they resemble primitive humans with grey-green skin covered with coarse hair. Orcs have a slightly stooped posture, a low jutting forehead, and a snout instead of a nose, though comparisons between this facial feature and those of pigs are exaggerated and perhaps unfair. Orcs have well-developed canine teeth for eating meat and short pointed ears that resemble those of a wolf. Orcish snouts and ears have a slightly pink tinge. Their eyes are human, with a reddish tint that sometimes makes them appear to glow red when they reflect dim light sources in near darkness. This is actually part of their optical system, a pigment which gives them infravision. Male orcs are about 5Â½ to 6 feet tall. Females average 6 inches shorter than males. Orcs prefer to wear colors that most humans think unpleasant: blood red, rust red, mustard yellow, yellow green, moss green, greenish purple, and blackish brown. Their armor is unattractive besides â€“ dirty and often a bit rusty.
    Orcs speak Orcish, a language derived from older human and elvish languages. There is no common standard of Orcish, so the language has many dialects which vary from tribe to tribe. Orcs have also learned to speak local common tongues, but are not comfortable with them. Some orcs have a limited vocabulary in goblin, hobgobli , and ogre dialects.
  Combat: |
    Orcs are constantly in battle. They use the following weapons.
    sword and flail 5%
    sword and spear 10%
    axe and spear 10%
    axe and polearm 10%
    axe and crossbow 10%
    axe and bow 10%
    sword and battleaxe 5%
    spear 10%
    axe 10%
    polearm 20%
    Polearms are typically either halberds, pikes (set to receive charge), or glaives. Leaders typically possess two weapons. If a subchief is present, there is a 40% chance the orcs will be fighting around a standard. The presence of this standard increases attack rolls and morale by +1 for all orcs within 60 yards. Orcs typically wear studded leather armor and a shield (AC 6).
    Orcs hate direct sunlight and fight at -1 penalty to their attack rolls in sunlight. Their morale decreases by 1 under these circumstances as well. Orcs employ sniping and ambush tactics in the wild. They do not obey the "rules of war" unless such is in their best interests; for example, they will shoot at those who attempt to parlay with them under a white flag unless the orc leader feels it is advantageous to hear what the enemy has to say. They abuse human rules of engagement and chivalry to their best advantage. They have a historic enmity against elves and dwarves; many tribes will kill these demihumans on sight.
    It is often believed that orcs are so bloodthirsty and cruel that they are ineffective tacticians and that they would rather be vicious than victorious. Like most stereotypes, this is highly misleading; it is true for some orc tribes but not for all. Many orc tribes have waged wars for decades and have developed a frightening efficiency with battle tactics.
  Habitat/Society: |
    For every three orcs encountered, there will be a leader and three assistants. These orcs will have 8 hit points each, being the meanest and strongest in the group. If 150 orcs or more are encountered there will be the following additional figures with the band: a subchief and 3-18 guards, each with Armor Class 4, 11 hit points, and +1 damage due to Strength on all attacks. They fight as monsters of 2 Hit Dice (THAC0 19). For every 100 orcs encountered, there will be either a shaman (maximum 5th level priest) or a witch doctor (maximum 4th-level mage). Shamans and witch doctors gain an extra 1d4 hit points for each level above 1st and fight as a monster of 1 Hit Die for every two levels (round fractions up) of spell-casting ability (e.g., a 5th-level shaman has d8+4d4 hit points and fights as a 3 Hit Dice monster.)
    If the orcs are not in their lair, there is a 20% chance they will be escorting a train of 1-6 carts and 10-60 slave bearers bringing supplies, loot, or ransom and tribute to their orc chief or a stronger orc tribe. The total value of the goods carried by all of the carts will vary between 10 and 1,000 silver pieces, and each slave bearer will bear goods valued between 5 and 30 silver pieces. If the orcs are escorting a treasure train, double the number of leaders and assistants and add 10 orcs for each cart in the train; one subchief with 5-30 guards will always be in charge.
    Orc lairs are underground 75% of the time, in a wilderness village 25% of the time. Orc communities range from small forts with 100-400 orcs to mining communities with 500-2,000 orcs to huge cities (partially underground and partially above ground) with 2,000 to 20,000 orcs. There will always be additional orcs when the encounter is in a creature's lair: a chief and 5-30 bodyguards (AC 4, 13-16 hit points, attack as monsters with 3 Hit Dice (THAC0 17) and inflict an extra +2 damage on all attacks due to Strength). If the lair is underground, there is a 50% chance that 2-5 ogres per 200 orcs will be living with them. Most lairs above ground are rude villages of wooden huts protected by a ditch, log rampart and log palisade, or more advanced constructions built by other races. The village will have 1-4 watch towers and a single gate. There will be one ballista and one catapult for every 100 adult male orcs.
    Orcs are aggressive. They believe other species are inferior to them and that bullying and slavery is part of the natural order. They will cooperate with other species but are not dependable: as slaves, they will rebel against all but the most powerful masters; as allies they are quick to take offense and break agreements. Orcs believe that battle is the ideal challenge, but some leaders are pragmatic enough to recognize the value of peace, which they exact at a high price. If great patience and care are used, orc tribes can be effective trading partners and military allies.
    Orcs value territory above all else; battle experience, wealth, and number of offspring are other major sources of pride. Orcs are patriarchal; women are fit only to serve the family and male order, raising orc-children (if such can be described as â€œraising,â€�), preforming domestic work, etc. Orcs have a reputation for cruelty that is deserved, but humans are just as capable of evil as orcs. Orcs have marriage customs, but orc males are not noted for their faithfulness.
    Orcs worship many deities (some who have different names among different tribes); the chief deity is usually a giant, one-eyed orc. Orcish religion is extremely hateful toward other species and urges violence and warfare. Orc shamans have been noted for their ambition, and many tribes have suffered because of political infighting between warriors and priests.
  Ecology: |
    Orcs have an average lifespan of 40 years. They have a gestation period of 10 months and produce two to three offspring per birth. Infant mortality is high. Orcs are carnivores, but prefer game meats or livestock to demihumans and humanoids.
    It is said that orcs have no natural enemies, but they work hard to make up for this lack. Orc tribes have fearsome names such as Vile Rune, Bloody Head, Broken Bone, Evil Eye, and Dripping Blade.
    Orcs are skilled miners who can spot new and unusual constructions 35% of the time and sloping passages 25% of the time. They are also excellent weaponsmiths.
  Orog: |
    Elite orcs, or orogs, are a race of great orcs, possibly mixed with ogre blood. Orogs range between 6 and 6Â½ feet tall. They are highly disciplined warriors and have their own standards and banners which they display prominently â€“ it is usually easy to tell when orogs are present among common orcs. Orogs can be found at the vanguard of large orc armies, but rarely on patrol. There is a 10% chance that an orc tribe will have orogs, whose number equals 10% of the male population. (Thus a community of 3,000 male orcs has a 10% chance of having 300 additional orogs.) Small bands of elites (20-80 orogs) will hire themselves out as mercenaries. Orogs have 3 Hit Dice, plate mail (AC 3), and have a +3 Strength bonus on damage dice. For every 20 orogs, there will also be one leader with 4 Hit Dice (THAC0 17). There is but one orog chief, who has 5 Hit Dice (THAC0 15). Orogs use weaponry common to orcs, but will typically possess two weapons apiece.
  Half-Orc: |
    Orcs will crossbreed with virtually every humanoid and demihuman species except elves, with whom they cannot. The mongrel offspring of orcs and these other species are known as half-orcs. Orc-goblins, orc-hobgoblins, and orc-humans are the most common. Half-orcs tend to favor the orcish strain heavily, and as such are basically orcs, although 10% of these offspring can pass as ugly humans. They are treated as humans with levels instead of Hit Dice. If multi-classed, they have these maximums: priest, 4th level; fighter, 10th level; thief, 8th level.
    If half-orcs remain single-classed, these maximums increase to: priest, 7th level (Wisdom 15 required for 5th, Wisdom 16 for 6th, Wisdom 17 for 7th); fighter, 17th level (Strength 18/00 required for 11th, Strength 19 for 12th, Strength 20 for 14th, and Strength 21 for 17th); thief, 11th level (Dexterity 15 required for 9th, Dexterity 16 for 10th, and Dexterity 17 for 11th).
    Half-orcs are distrusted by both human and orc cultures because they remind each of the other's racial stock. Half-orcs advance in orc culture by flaunting their superior ability and in human culture by associating with people who don't care about appearance. Most tend toward neutrality with slight lawful and evil tendencies, but lawful good half-orcs are not unknown. Some half-orcs have split from both cultures to form their own societies in remote areas. These half-orcs worship their own gods and (like most hermits) are extremely suspicious of strangers.

  Description: |
    The phlog-crawler is a form of phlogiston entity. It takes the form of a piece of the phlogisto and enjoys total access to wildspace . It travels in both the flow and wildspace alike, in search of prey for its voracious appetite. It moves about apparently propelled simply by its desire.
    The crawler, from a distance, appears to be a small cloud with eight writhing appendages (giving it a spider-like appearance) floating in space. Up close, however, the swirling, rainbow colors of the phlogiston become apparent. Because the phlog-crawler has no defined shape and no known mass, it can move freely through even the smallest cracks and crevices. Inside the phlogiston, the crawler is virtually undetectable at distances greater than melee range.
  Combat: |
    The phlog-crawler has no motivation other than hunger. Because its appetite is seemingly endless, to see a phlog-crawler is to be attacked by a phlog-crawler. The creature attacks by coming in contact with its intended prey and draining Strength from it. No type of armor offers any protection from this attack. Each round that the victim is in contact with a phlog-crawler, he must roll a saving throw vs. breath weapon. If he fails the saving throw, the victim loses 1 point of Strength. Upon reaching 0 Strength he is dead. If the victim manages to escape from or kill the crawler, he regains lost Strength at a rate of 1 point per turn.
    Attacking a phlog-crawler is, at best, a difficult undertaking. Because the crawler is little more than a mist, it is immune to nonmagical weapons. Even magical weapons inflict negligible damage â€“ 1 point per bonus of the weapon (e.g., a long sword +2 would inflict 2 points of damage on a successful hit).
    The only other way to damage a phlog-crawler is to burn it or use spells. The former method is a dangerous prospect indeed. Any flame â€“ magical or otherwise â€“ coming in contact with a phlog-crawler can certainly destroy it, but it causes the creature to erupt in the equivalent of a 5-die fireball , causing damage to anyone in a radius equal to twice the length of the crawler.
    Using spells to fight the phlog-crawler is a far less dangerous affair. However, anyone in contact with the crawler is also subject to any spells cast at the crawler. For example, if a 3rd-level wizard casts a magic missile spell at a phlog-crawler that is draining one of his companions, both the crawler and the companion would suffer the damage.
    A phlog-crawler has the ability to sense open flames and will not approach them. If a flame is lit during combat, there is a 75% chance that the creature will flee at maximum speed away from the encounter. It is also unlikely to attack any large group of individuals unless it has not fed in a long while.
    The phlog-crawler causes the air pocket of any object less than one ton in mass that it comes in contact with to foul and then become poisonous in half the usual amount of time.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Phlog-crawlers are found in both the phlogiston and wildspace alike. Because individuals and small groups â€“ the primary prey of the crawlers â€“ are unlikely to be encountered within the phlogiston, phlog-crawlers are encountered mostly in wildspace. Because of their vulnerability to ranged attacks and flames, they tend to hide among rocks and ship ruins and attack by surprise. Phlog-crawlers can survive for up to 24 hours within an atmosphere, but they rarely enter one.
  Ecology: |
    Phlog-crawlers have no diet other than the life energy of living creatures. They can sense the presence of life up to several miles away and attack any small groups of people automatically (unless they have an open flame, of course). If the creature is starved and has not fed for some time â€“ usually after several weeks â€“ it will attack anything without heed for its own safety.
    Phlog-crawlers have no known natural enemies. Their life cycle is unknown, but some of the great sages of Toril speculate that they are virtually immortal. In some crystal spheres , captured phlog-crawlers (a very rare thing indeed) are used to make powerful potions of longevity.

  Description: |
    When the githyanki, under their liberator, Gith, freed themselves from the yoke of mindflayer slavery, this branch of the race fled not to the Astral plane, but to arcane space.
    Tall, emaciated beings, the pirates of Gith appear as almost skeletal humanoids with skin varying from dirty gray to dull yellow. Long, dingy-brown hair flows down their backs and over the ornate, bejeweled arms and armor they prefer to use.
  Combat: |
    The pirates of Gith can operate as fighters, mages, or fighter/mages, with limits of 11 in each class. Typically, the highest-level fighter captains the ship. This frees all the mages (single-and multiclassed) for spelljamming or combat duty.
    Clerics of Gith are occasionally encountered as well (limit of 11th level). Rarely, a fighter/cleric is encountered, almost always as the captain of its ship.
    When closing with a foe, the pirates use spells and any armament their ship possesses. In melee, they use a variety of weapons, with swords predominating.
    Operating from small bases hidden on asteroids , the pirates strive to capture any ship that is larger, faster, or better armed than theirs. They feverishly attempt to capture any elven-made ships that come their way (see below). As a result, many elve armadas post large bounties on the heads of Gith pirates.
    The pirates' greatest fury is reserved for the illithids, however. The pirates of Gith spare no expense to kill all mindflayers they find. No Gith pirate ever uses a captured illithid ship.
    A ship's complement varies, but these numbers are a general guideline:
    1 Captain (highest-level fighter or fighter/cleric)
    1 Mate (highest-level fighter/mage or cleric)
    1 Chief Spelljammer or Warlock (highest-level mage)
    The rest of the crew is evenly divided among the three common class possibilities.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The pirate philosophy carries over into all aspects of life. The strongest take what they want. Each ship is very important to its crew, as it is the primary factor in determining the pecking order in a settlement. This explains the pirates' constant quest for better ships. Each settlement is ruled by force by its best ship, or a coalition of the best ships.
    Extreme isolationists, the pirates of Gith live with no other races â€“ they may even try to commit genocide on a race that settles too close to them. Overall, despite being pirates, these Gith live a structured, militaristic lifestyle.
    Every adult member of this race possesses the following magical abilities, each usable three times a day: astral spell , plane shift , and ESP . All function as the spell of the same name (as cast by the lowest-level caster possible). These inherent abilities also enable the pirates to pilot ships with series helms. These abilities function only in wildspace , not in the phlogisto.
    The most dangerous aspect of this race is the combination of the above abilities, the properties of major and minor spelljamming helms , and the unique organic structure of the elven-made ships. When a Gith pirate is at the helm of an elven-made ship ( flitter , etc.), he may use his plane shift and astral spell abilities to shunt the entire ship, and all its contents, to the Astral plane (this uses up that pirate's astral spell and plane shift abilities for the day). This gives the pirates an escape route, and it enables them to wait in known shipping lanes, astrally hidden, before returning to the Prime Material plane to launch an attack. The Gith pirates can use only elven-made ships of less than 50 tons in this manner. This special maneuver only works in wildspace, not in the phlogiston. That is certainly the reason the Gith pirates never pursue prey into that medium.
  Ecology: |
    The Gith pirates are carnivores, pure and simple. They do not care what state, short of putrefied, the meat is in. Some of the pirate bands also engage in cannibalism.

  Description: |
    These creatures look very much like gremlins or imps, belonging in fact to the same family. Devilish little creatures that love to prey upon those weaker or in smaller numbers, the plainsjan have pointed little ears much like those of elves , but they have very sharp teeth and large claws for their size. Their small but stout tails are sometimes used for balance when feeding upon taller targets.
  Combat: |
    The plainsjan is a creature that thrives almost completely upon the freshly killed flesh of umber hulks , supplementing the diet with other humanoids or creatures. When plainsjan attack, they always do so in numbers that warrant their winning. They attack in groups, biting and scratching from as many different directions as possible.
    The bite of a plainsjan has a slight intoxicating effect which is easily shaken off. A successful save vs. poison, with a bonus of +1, easily eliminates its effects. The poison otherwise causes one to fight at -1 because of the slight delirium. Besides, the victim's Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, and Intelligence temporarily fall one point for 2d4 rounds. This poison effect is cumulative, which makes these creatures dangerous opponents if not properly dealt with quickly.
    Their claws are so sharp that, due to blood loss, they inflict an additional point of damage for each of two subsequent melee rounds unless the wounds are dealt with immediately. When these pests attack, they usually use all three attack modes each melee round.
  Habitat/Society: |
    These creatures live in tight family- and friend-oriented clans. These groups of plainsjan hunt and fight together. They tend to be quite territorial as well.
    Plainsjan prefer to live in arid areas where water is hard to find. Currently, most are near the Anadian equator, but a few have been spotted in the deserts of Toril . This spread is due to the carelessness of spelljamming adventurers, or perhaps the vitality of some people's evil streak. Wherever they are seen, plainsjan run rampant, killing everything they can.
    When these creatures breed, their progeny are always born in sets of twos - either identical twins or multiple sets of identical twins are born. The twins spend the rest of their lives together, sharing the same mates and food supplies.

  Description: |
    Plasmen are the peculiar constructs of deranged wizards, conjured simultaneously from the elemental planes of Fire and Earth. Bizarre and completely unnatural (even from a magical standpoint), plasmen are internally at war with themselves. They take out their inner turmoil in a horrible frenzy of destruction that is usually as dangerous for their creators as for anyone else. In their rage they quickly break down into their material components of fire and earth, though some who make their way to fire-based worlds or stars can attain immortality in these places where the elemental planes of Fire and Earth are in harmony in the Prime Material plane.
    A plasman is a horrifying creature, roughly man-shaped but much taller. Its exterior is a broken collection of what appear to be white-hot coals or stones, stacked unnaturally into the shape of a man. From within it burns with the fire of a kiln, the intense light and flame licking out from between the stones, dancing across its surface in a constant swirl of deadly, searing heat. Plasmen have no facial features, not even a mouth â€“ sustenance is gained by simply merging with rock or metal, melting it and smearing it onto its body, or by absorbing flame or combustible materials (wood, oil, cloth, etc.) to feed its inner fire.
  Combat: |
    A plasman is at war with itself and with all creatures that cross its path. It shows no mercy, attacking without regard to situation, alignment, or even its own estimation of victory. A plasman's only attack is to punch with its flaming fist. If a hit is scored, the target suffers 2d8 points of crushing damage from the rock-hard fist, plus 2d6 points of flame damage. The flame damage is also incurred even by casual contact with a plasman.
    Plasmen also have a special attack they can use once per turn. If the plasman spends an entire round not attacking, on the next round it can concentrate its internal fires into a blast of intense heat. This blast attack scorches victims within five feet for 3d6 points of damage, those within ten feet for 2d6 points of damage, and those within 20 feet for 1d6 points of damage (all victims get to roll saving throws vs. spell for half damage).
    In combat, a plasman cannot be harmed by weapons of less than +2 enchantment. Of these weapons, edged ones cause only half damage to the flowing, molten stones of a plasman's outer shell. Fire-based spells have no effect on plasmen. No common means of extinguishing fire on the Prime Material plane is capable of harming a plasman. Spells of magical cold and water inflict normal damage. Spells that alter stone work normally. An entire gallon of water poured onto a plasman causes 1d6 points of damage.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Once conjured, plasmen have no loyalty to their creators, attacking them as readily as anyone else. They survive for 1d6 days after their creators stop concentrating on them. After that, they collapse back into the hot coals of a wood fire, the very stuff from which they were created.
    If a plasman can reach a fire-based world or a star before it burns out, it can survive there indefinitely. Still troubled and violent, it takes to the space around those places, hovering, waiting for passersby on which to vent its burning anger.
  Ecology: |
    Plasmen have little purpose in any ecosystem. They contribute only death and destruction. There are no known uses for any part of plasmen.

  Description: |
    Power symbionts are the bane of all spelljamming farers. They do nothing but rob the power from various magical items on the ship. These creatures have been found on various planets , as well. This has created a dislike for spelljamming in some areas.
    A power symbiont is a creature that looks very much like swamp fungus. It is dark brown in color, unless it is currently feeding on magical emanations (during which process it is rust colored). They breed asexually once they have grown to twice their standard size of Â¼ inch in diameter.
  Combat: |
    These creatures reflect spells cast at them back to the source, with no diminution of strength. This can be an advantage to a ship infested by power symbionts. If a ship is magically attacked and a symbiont is in the spell effect, the spell is reflected back to the attacking ship. In a case like this, neither the caster nor the attacking ship receive any Dexterity or SR bonus to the saving throws.
  Habitat/Society: |
    These creatures do not purposefully create a society. They may be found together only where there are sufficient magical emanations to warrant their numbers. Once the magical properties of the item have been drained, they abandon it.
  Ecology: |
    Power symbionts are attracted to the magical auras that they sense through wildspace . They are unable to move quickly, and can only hope that the ship actually scoops them up with its gravitational pull.
    Once on the ship, they begin to move about at a movement rate of Â¼, in search of magical auras. Once one is found, the symbionts head straight for it. They can sense the auras of magical items from 20 feet away. If they sense another aura as they travel toward the first, it is ignored, unless it is a stronger aura. They continue this way until they find the most appetizing item. They then attach themselves to the item and begin feeding.
    Once the item has lost all charges (a power symbiont drains one charge per round; see the list below for figuring the number of charges in an item), the power symbiont dispatches 1d8 Â¼" symbionts to search for another source of magical energy. The rest of the symbiont dies, hardening in one day to a hard, brown lump.
    If the symbionts that have been dispatched from the drained item cannot find another magical source within one week, they traverse the gravity plane of the ship and throw themselves back into wildspace. If they happen to enter the phlogisto , they die immediately.
    The total number of charges in a magical item can be computed from the following list:
    1 charge per plus of a weapo
    1 charge per charge of a rod, staff or wand
    1 charge for semi-empathy
    1 charge per Intelligence point
    1 charge per language known
    2 charges per Ego point
    2 charges per primary ability
    2 charges for empathy
    3 charges for speech
    4 charges for telepathy
    6 charges per extraordinary power
    10 charges per special purpose
    12 charges per special purpose power

    Size: S (3Â½'); M (5') with sphere
    Morale: Steady (12); Champion (16) with sphere
    XP Value: 10,000
  Description: |
    Pristatics resemble a sphere of swirling colors, much like the prismatic sphere spell. Within the sphere is the actual pristatic, a small gnome-like humanoid. While bereft of its sphere, the pristatic floats in the phlogisto with legs and arms crossed, a look of intense concentration on its face.
    A long-standing legend maintains that pristatics were created when a wizard attempted to alter the prismatic sphere spell by combining it with a teleport spell (in order to drop a sphere into the middle of a group). Unfortunately his assistant, a young gnome , tripped and bolluxed the experiment, disappearing in the process. A more reasonable conjecture is that the pristatic is native to the phlogiston; it may be a key to unknown secrets of magic.
  Combat: |
    Pristatics avoid combat. Though adult pristatics innately have all the abilities of the 9th-level wizard spell prismatic sphere , they can use it only once per day, for a total of two hours at most. Therefore, pristatics are willing to endure some damage before resorting to this, their only means of defense.
    The pristatic's colorful sphere is still visible even when not in use. There is no way to detect whether the prismatic sphere effects are currently active. Detect magic always registers the area as magical, since it is composed of the ambient magical forces of the phlogiston.
    In contrast to the prismatic sphere spell, an adult pristatic can activate some or all of its sphere's layers. For example, the pristatic can invoke the orange, indigo and violet effects, leaving out the other colors. The pristatic selects these effects to inflict the least harm to its opponent. Only when near death does it erect all layers against attackers.
    If characters converse with a pristatic, it answers any questions it can. Pristatics are good observers and can remember the type and bearing of all ships that have passed within about the last month. However, the pristatic has no way to measure the passage of time, making its recollections less helpful.
    Pristatics cannot spelljam. They bob in the phlogiston, going where the rainbow stream takes them.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Pristatics have no social structure, for they are solitary beings. They prefer the vastness of the phlogiston over the company of others.
  Ecology: |
    Innate magic in the phlogiston is food for the pristatic. If brought into a crystal sphere , a pristatic's life force rapidly fades, and it dies within a day after leaving the phlogiston. Curative magic doesn't help the pristatic, although placing it inside a wizard's prismatic sphere prolongs its life for 24 hours. Similarly, if a dying pristatic returns to the phlogiston before the 24 hours are up, it returns to health in the same amount of time that it was away from the phlogiston.

    XP Value: 2,000
  Description: |
    The puffer is a durable creature that can bear the rigors of wildspace for years at a time while in its dormant state. Yet, when it lands upon an asteroid or ship and becomes active, it can become a terrible killing machine, often leaving a wasteland in its wake.
    In its dormant state the puffer resembles a tightly-stretched balloon â€“ a featureless sphere floating through wildspace. It can be as large as 40' in diameter, or perhaps as small as half that, depending on how long it has been dormant. Upon close inspection, its smooth skin looks obviously different from an asteroid or other natural object.
    When active, the puffer resembles a cross between a crocodile and a scorpion. It has a mouthful of sharp fangs and a poison stinger in its tail, which it keeps curled over its back, ready to strike a foe in any direction.
    A puffer can propel itself slowly through wildspace by exhaling a small trickle of air. It cannot approach spelljammer speed, of course, but it can sense any ship or other large object within 100 miles. The puffer slowly approaches the object and, if it can catch it, lands and immediately becomes active.
    A puffer can make some 5-10 attempts to land somewhere before its supply of air is exhausted. If this occurs before it can land, the puffer dies in space without reproducing.
  Combat: |
    A puffer can fight only in active mode. It can be slain when dormant, if characters reach it in wildspace. In fact, when thus killed, its body becomes a valuable source of air. As soon as a puffer comes into contact with more than one ton of air, however, it becomes active.
    The bite of the puffer inflicts 1d12 points of damage, while the stinger causes 1d6. In addition, those struck by the stinger must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or die.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Puffers spend most of their lives in the ultimate seclusion â€“ the eternal dark and cold of wildspace beyond the outermost planets . Once in its life, however, a puffer tries to land. After landing, it must kill some creature to serve as host for its eggs. These it lays, and then it returns to wildspace to die.
    The eggs hatch three to four weeks later, releasing 1d100 tiny, active puffers into whatever environment fortune has placed them (hp 1 each, AC 10, THAC0 19). These tiny puffers have stingers every bit as lethal as the adult's. Each of them seeks a warm-blooded animal as a victim, which they attempt to sting to death. If successful, the little puffer devours the kill, growing quickly as it does so.
    After the meal, it slowly begins to inhale air, inflating until it is a dormant ball some 30-40' across. Then, with an expulsion of air, it shoots slowly into wildspace at non-spelljamming speed, where it will spend the next years or even decades.
  Ecology: |
    Puffers feed on meat, and they seek creatures of huma size or larger for their kills. They can grow and lay their eggs using smaller creatures for sustenance, but it takes many of these for each activity, as opposed to one good-sized carcass of 150-200 lbs.
    Puffers cannot survive the extreme of a fall from space to a fullsized planet, nor can their air-blown drives carry them from a planet into space. Thus, they confine their activities to ships, asteroids, and other small objects in space.

  Description: |
    The q'nidar are bat-like creatures that frequent the warmer areas of wildspace in search of food. They appear as gigantic bats with a semi-crystalline hide (not unlike that of the radiant dragon in appearance). The q'nidar feed on heat and light, which can be seen constantly arcing around and through them; from afar, these heat and light patterns streak behind them, resembling a vaporous trail. The draco were the first to encounter these creatures and named them "q'nidar", or heat-eaters. The rest of the races in space usually refer to the creatures as "vapor bats".
    The q'nidar have a unique form of communication: They "speak" via a thermal breath that is easily detected and understood by other q'nidar. Even though they feed on heat and light, they are not always found near heat-based celestial bodies ; too much background heat confuses their senses and their speech.
  Combat: |
    Q'nidar are attracted to spelljamming ships because of the lights and activity, as well as curiosity. In the past, q'nidar would confuse ships with other vapor bats and speak with the ship, resulting in disaster.
    The breath of a q'nidar is extremely hot. It is harmless in the void, but, when exposed to the atmospheric envelope of a ship, it ignites the air in its path and any flammables it contacts. The breath weapon is a cone of fire 30 feet long that is ten feet wide at its far end. Anyone within the area of the flame suffers 2d12 points of damage, and any flammable materials must roll successful saving throws or ignite. The breath also causes 1d3 points of hull damage (wooden and organic hulls only).
    The vapor bats generally wait for fires they started to build to 5-point intensity (5 hull points of damage per round), and then they begin absorbing the heat and light from the flames. This process extinguishes the flames in two rounds. Thus, the bats put out any flames they caused, but only if given the chance. If attacked while talking, a vapor bat will scream at the ship, causing an additional 1d12 points of damage with its breath, and an added point of hull damage. It continues to scream until it is no longer interrupted while feeding.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Q'nidar travel in a single-line formation to feed upon the heat trails of the pack leader. Their flight in wildspace is erratic because they get confused by background thermals. The vapor bats have learned that much food is generated by talking with spelljamming ships, and thus they are commonly found along the spaceways and trade lanes of space. They are simple creatures, meaning no malice, but they are still one of the feared monsters of the void.
    Q'nidar are capable of moving at spelljamming speed ( SR of 3), but only after they have absorbed major amounts of heat and light. If a q'nidar is brought out of spelljamming speed by a passing ship, it needs food to maintain its speed, and it begins breathing on the ship to generate heat and light for its needs. Q'nidar rarely need to absorb more than 5 or 6 points of heat energy before returning to spelljamming speed.
    Q'nidar are never found in the phlogisto except in their rare, crystalline form (see "Ecology"). In the phlogiston, the vapor bats' breath causes a constant fireball about the q'nidar and effectively kills them by overabsorption of heat. Q'nidar killed in the phlogiston this way have a different crystal structure, and this crystal is quite useful for creating a crystal ball. Q'nidar subjected to fireballs of greater Hit Dice than their own will absorb all the heat and light, forming this same crystal.
  Ecology: |
    The hides of the q'nidar make effective components of heat- and light-based spells. When heated, the scales are quite effective for extra lighting. Remains of the q'nidar are rarely encountered, outside of those killed along the tradeways.
    Responding to some racial instinct, the dying q'nidar dive toward the nearest star, absorbing heat and light until their bodies crystallize fully. Often, these bodies of crystal simply get pulled into the star, but some have been recovered. The crystalline formation reacts like a spelljamming helm , absorbing not only heat and light, but magic. The crystalline remains may be carved into a small chair, creating a minor spelljamming helm.

  Description: |
    The radiant dragon, also called the star drago or the celestial drago (though not to be confused with the oriental dragon of the same name), is a sinuous, serpentine drago with graceful, translucent wings. Its scales are a collection of glittering pearl-like shards of mica and gypsum, which cause the dragon's scales to shimmer in the starlight, giving the creature its name.
    Radiant dragons can be of any alignment, unlike the tendencies toward good and evil of the chromatic and metallic dragons. There exist radiant dragons who terrorize the spaceways, those who act in a beneficial fashion, and those who prefer to set themselves up as whimsical king-gods on small, distant worlds. As a class, the radiant dragons are proud, haughty, and feel they are the ultimate in draconian development: they are, after all, the largest of their type.
    Radiant dragons speak their own language and the common tongue. They are quick with languages and fond of mimicry, so they tend to speak in a number of accents matching those of the individuals they talk with. There is a 10% chance that even a hatchling will understand any given tongue, with an increase of 5% for every age category.
    All common dragon attributes outlined in the Dragon General Information Page apply to radiant dragons as well. Modifications to the general description that apply specifically to fantasy space are listed below.
  Combat: |
    Actions of a radiant dragon depend on the situation and the individual. They rarely flee from a fight, however, depending on their huge size to keep them safe from opponents.
    A radiant dragon will concentrate on the ship itself first, seeking to first destroy or eliminate any serious threats (such as ballistas and catapults ). Of equal importance is elimination of the mages and any with magical powers. If the radiant dragon is aligned toward good, he will seek to neutralize them with silence, 15' radius spells (if available). If less concerned about killing, he will merely slay hostile wizards as he finds them.
    The wing buffet used by young adult and older dragons is particularly potent in the small space of a ship, and has the effect of a "Ship Shaken" critical hit, and in addition inflicts 2-20 points of damage to all within the range of the attack (about 200 feet to either side).
    In addition to the tail slap used by the radiant dragon against groups of creatures, the radiant dragon may grip a ship in the coils of its tail and inflict damage per round by squeezing it. The damage is 1-6 hull points against lighter materials such as wood or ceramic, but particularly heavy materials, such as stone and metal, suffer only 1-4 hull points damage. The dragon can make other attacks, and even attack other ships, while squeezing a ship.
    As a general rule, radiant dragons will give a ship and crew the opportunity to leave, parley, or generally bow and scrape and beg for its kindness and mercy. Even the smallest of these creatures has an overweening sense of pride.
  Breath Weapon/Special Abilities: |
    The radiant dragon breathes glowing pulses of force that in some ways resemble magic missiles . They can breathe a single pulse of the listed damage, or any number of smaller pulses in the same round, provided that no pulse inflicts less than 2d12+1 points of damage. A juvenile radiant dragon (age 4) can breathe a single pulse of 8d12+4 points, or four pulses of 2d12+1 points, or two pulses of 4d12+2 points. Each pulse can strike a separate target. These pulses are unerring in their attacks, and will hit unless the victim makes a saving throw vs. breath weapon. If the victim fails its saving throw, it will be struck for the listed damage. If the victim makes its saving throw, it has dodged that pulse, which then evaporates.
    The radiant dragon can use its breath weapon on physical objects (such as a ship) as well, inflicting 1 hull point of damage for every 10 hit points of damage its breath weapon causes. Other physical objects must save vs. spell to survive being hit by a pulse.
    As radiant dragons age, they gain a number of innate abilities. Juvenile dragons can restore or corrupt air as per the spell. A young adult may use the Bigby's interposing hand * spell, while adults can use the Bigby's grasping hand * spell. A mature adult ca shapechange three times in a standard day, gaining the abilities of the creature that it mimics, even to the point of spells and magical ability. Venerable radiant dragons can create a wall of force (as the wand), and a wyrm can use forcecage (as the spell). A great wyrm can create a prismatic sphere large enough to encapsulate itself and up to 4 other creatures of similar size, and to maintain it indefinitely.
    The radiant dragons refer to these as the interposing claw and grasping claw spells, and will declare loudly that this Bigby is an interloper who obviously stole their spells and gave them his name. A careful check by the sages indicate that the reverse is true: These spells did not appear commonly among the radiants until Bigby developed them. However, given the size and temperament of those dragons making the claim, few have chosen to argue the point with them.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Radiant dragons are totally spaceborne â€“ indeed, their huge size would make them ungainly creatures on most worlds. Mature adults do mingle among mere mortals, often taking the face and the role of an adventurer or hero as the dragon passes through the asteroid citadels. A character who is faced with unpaid bills for services from places he has never visited may guess that his renown is great enough to earn him the mimicry of a radiant dragon. In some regions this is considered a great honor (once it is confirmed by detect lie and other divination spells). In other areas of space it is considered a blasted nuisance.
    The radiant dragons are normally solitary and very territorial about their "turf", which can include up to the space surrounding a planet or moo . When they are found in numbers, they are usually a family group, and make their lair in an asteroid hollowed out by the parents. Some hollow asteroids that are used by certain huma civilizations were created by these dragons.
    When in family groups, radiant dragons are very protective, and slaying the young is a sure way of earning a radiant dragon's enmity. It will hunt down the individual responsible, devising nasty methods of revenge as it goes. There is a giff saying: "Better to be slain by a star dragon quickly, before it has a chance to think about it."
  Ecology: |
    Radiant dragons can survive long periods in space. They are sometimes seen near fire bodies with their wings spread, gliding on the heat, and it is surmised that they can take the energy from such celestial bodies and store it in their bodies, much like the kindori . However, a selfish and hungry radiant dragon can just as easily descend on an asteroid citadel and clean out all other living things (particularly if it considers the asteroid its "own" from an earlier stage of life).
    The clerical spell ability of the radiant dragons may make them the only living creatures of such great bulk to be natural spelljammers. They move in this fashion as a cleric with as many levels as the dragon's age when piloting a major helm , and the dragons can do so at will without tiring. On occasion they have used this ability to rescue or tow wrecked ships (in return for a promise of reward, or a statue in their name at least). Radiant dragon hatchlings stay close to their lairs and the protection of the parents, but sometimes they also sneak out and do some spelljamming.
    It is unknown if the radiant dragons have spelljamming ability naturally or as the result of some deal with the arcane . One school of thought indicates that the radiant dragons are the only natural spelljamming creatures, and the arcane use them to make their helms. A second school believes that the radiants gained this ability from the arcanes in exchange for transportation or other favors. The truth has yet to be revealed. The arcane and the radiant dragons, when brought into contact, have little to say to each other.
    The radiant dragons are friendly with dracons and lizard me , whom they encourage to worship them at every chance. They are haughty toward men, elves , halflings , and most mammal-based races. They consider mind flayers , beholders , and neogis to be genetic failures that have not had the sense to die off. This opinion is reciprocated by those races, which hunt the radiants whenever they have a chance and think they can beat them. In addition, radiant dragons are occasionally attacked by the largest kraje.
    Radiant dragons can be encountered in any wildspace area and in the phlogisto . Their great size gives them their own atmospheric envelope, but unlike the similarly huge kindori, they do not encourage riders, and will often preen their scales to remove krajen spores and other hitchhikers. Their clerical abilities operate in any sphere that has dragons as a native life form. In those rare spheres without dragons, they still retain first and second level spells and their spelljamming ability.

  Description: |
    The radiant golem is a unique creature that some claim is as old as the races of elves , gnomes , and dwarves.
    In physical appearance, the radiant golem looks much like an iron golem. It stands somewhat taller, reaching a height of 15 feet and weighing roughly 6,000 pounds. It has been formed in the image of a powerfully built man with eyes that burn with a cool, blue light. The black body of the creature scintillates with an azure aura that fills the area around the creature with a smell of summer lightning.
    The radiant golem is able to speak with almost any creature it meets via an innate telepathic power. This ability transcends linguistic barriers and falters only when the golem is attempting to communicate with truly unusual creatures, such as cloakers or clockwork horrors.
  Combat: |
    The radiant golem is even more deadly than its iron cousins. Were it not for the fact that the creature abhors violence in any form, it would certainly be among the most deadly monsters known in any crystal sphere.
    In melee, a single blow from its mighty fist inflicts 6d10 points of damage. For the purposes of lifting and breaking objects, the radiant golem has a Strength of 25. The creature is immune to all weapons of less than +4 enchantment.
    In addition, this golem radiates a magical death aura . All beings who spend at least one hour of any 24-hour period within ten yards of the golem must roll a saving throw vs. death magic. If they fail, they suffer a permanent loss of 1d6 hit points. No magic short of a wish can restore these lost hit points. The saving throw (and hit point reduction) occur at the end of the 24-hour period in question. The golem cannot turn this power off.
    Magical attacks that are based on electricity cause no damage to the radiant golem, but they do slow it for one or two rounds. All other magical attacks are ignored, save for those of a fire- or heat-based nature, which restore 1 hit point to the creature for every die of damage they would normally inflict.
    Whenever the radiant golem takes damage from an attack, it tries to flee the area. If retreat is impossible, it turns and attacks. While engaged in melee, it repeatedly offers its foes the chance to break off hostilities.
    The radiant golem automatically regenerates 1d10 lost hit points at the end of any round.
  Habitat/Society: |
    One can best understand the radiant golem if one thinks of it as an orphan. Long ago, an unknown race created the mysterious creature in an attempt to improve upon the existing iron golems. They used a unique ore found on a lifeless asteroid to fashion the thing's body and wove magical spells never before crafted to breathe life into it.
    Unlike iron golems, the radiant golem has intelligence. While it is certainly not an intellectual giant, it is fully self-aware and able to reason and imagine. Its creators found that the creature was not useful as a guardian or warrior, because it would never take action to harm another creature. By the time they had learned about the golem's gentle and friendly nature, however, they had fallen victim to another unexpected power â€“ the death aura.
    Since that time, the radiant golem has drifted from crystal sphere to crystal sphere in an attempt to find friends. It longs to have companions who do not flee from it or succumb to its deadly presence. As such, it often latches onto parties of adventurers and tries to join their ranks. The golem is helpful to such companions, offering advice, lifting heavy weights, and doing everything a servant might do to make their lives easier (but shorter).
    The golem does not know about its death aura, and it will not understand or believe in the aura if told of its existence. Aware that it is almost immortal, the golem simply assumes that living things die very quickly. In fact, the golem often bemoans the fact that fate has made mortals so fragile. All it wants, as it will tell adventurers, is a friend.
  Ecology: |
    The radiant golem's death aura affects not only animal life, but plant life as well. In cases where the golem has set up a home for itself and spent a good deal of time in one area, the entire region is likely to become barren and lifeless. The aura does not affect unliving material, like stone and metal, or once living matter (like a wooden cart) in any way.

  Description: |
    The rastipede is an insect-like creature that can be encountered virtually anywhere, usually accompanying a wide variety of other creatures. A rastipede has a hard shell covering its body, which accounts for its low Armor Class. This is fortunate, since their odd body shape makes it impossible for them to wear any standard type of armor protection.
    Rastipedes have long lower bodies. Their eight legs enable them to scoot around very quickly. They also have a vaguely humanoid torso and one pair of arms. They strike spacefarers as a kind of insectoid centaur.
    The rastipede has a pair of antennae on its head that provide it with a very keen sense of smell. This sense is so keen that the rastipede cannot be surprised by a creature behind it, as long as that creature exudes any odor whatsoever. Also, the rastipede is ambidextrous and fully double-jointed.
  Combat: |
    Rastipedes can use the full range of weapons available to humans . Their specialty is a long bow designed and used specifically by their race. This long bow has ranges of 10/20/30, and it inflicts 1d12 points of damage on a successful hit.
    Rastipedes are inherently peaceful, however. This accounts for their preference for a missile weapon in combat. Also, the speed of the insectoids enables them to avoid many an unpleasant encounter.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Rastipedes are born from eggs, which are laid by a queen that reputedly lives deep within ground in a secluded cavern, wherever they creatures have nests. Rastipedes grow up with a strong sense of duty and responsibility to the nest and the community. All rastipedes are well taught in the literature of their own race, which is quite extensive, and mathematics.
    A nest of rastipedes might contain anywhere frown 100-600 individuals, half of which are immature, incapable of combat. The adults, however, are fanatically committed to the defense of the nest above all else.
    Many rastipedes study the magical arts. About 1 in 6 rastipedes encountered is a mage of 1st through 4th level. Though no rastipede has ever been known to learn a spell higher than 2nd level, they have sufficient skill to operate a spelljammer helm . In fact, a helm operated by a rastipede performs as if operated by a mage of three times the rastipede's spellcasting level. Thus, a rastipede who casts as a 4th-level mage can operate a spelljammer helm as a 12th-level mage!
    The primary interest of rastipedes, however, is trade. They commonly employ crews and hire ships to transport goods back and forth across wildspace , usually turning a profit with every voyage. Rastipedes engage in selling and buying of virtually any product, though most of them adhere rigidly to laws against smuggling or slave trafficking.
    Rastipedes are favored henchmen of the arcane . Very often, characters who seek an arcane find themselves dealing with a rastipede go-between. One reason for this is the well known bargaining skill of the rastipedes. Rumors suggest a darker, more sinister connection between the two races, but there is no evidence to indicate that any such association exists.
  Ecology: |
    Rastipedes can survive on virtually any kind of food. They need lots of water, but sunlight is apparently not a requirement of the race. Young rastipedes, born in the nest, might spend their first decade underground.

  Description: |
    The reigar are a near-legendary race, only rarely encountered by the average spacefaring adventurer. They are famed for their artistic prowess and fabulous command of craftsmanship.
    As a people, the reigar are androgynous. Their men are very beautiful and their women are extremely handsome. They are of tall huma proportions, willowy of build, with reddish-blond hair. Their natural beauty is augmented by the halo or glory surrounding each reigar. This glory is a cloud of twinkling, glittering motes that change color in random patterns. Some rumors say that this glory is lighter in color when the reigar is pleased, and darker when one is displeased. This has yet to be fully documented. This glory contributes to the reigar's tough Armor Class and high magic resistance.
  Combat: |
    Reigar prefer not to enter into combat personally, as their time is better spent in artistic pursuits (naturally). If attacked, they first send in their helots (golem-like creatures that have the same attacks as their organic counterparts: AC 2, MV by creature type, HD by creature type +2, unaffected by sleep and charm spells; helots do not have any special abilities or spell-like abilities their organic forms may possess). If that fails, they call in the lakshu . Only if the lakshu fail to defeat the opponents does a reigar deign to go toe-to-toe, as it were, with the attackers. And when it does, several hells break loose.
    In combat the reigar use an item called a shakti . This is a small (palm-sized) statuette that resembles a figurine of wondrous power (an item rumored to have been first created by a reigar). Each shakti is designed by and for its user, rendering each one effectively a unique item. A shakti has three purposes, or forms.
    First, there is its dormant form. In this state, it may be worn around the neck on a chain or cord, or hung from a kirtle or belt, or carried in a pouch or bag. Its shape is reminiscent of an animal or creature: a panther, a dragon, a phoenix, etc.
    On a command word known only to the creator/user, this form transmutes into a mode of transportation. The size increases to roughly eight feet long, and the shape changes to that of the creature depicted, lying prone. The reigar may sit or stand on the shakti in this form, and by mental command will it to move or stop. This form has a movement rate of 18 and an AC of -2.
    On a second command word (also, of course, known only to the creator/user), the shakti transforms into a suit of armor and an accompanying weapon. The armor is reminiscent of the animal represented by the shakti's dormant form, as is the special attack it bestows on its wearer. The weapon can be anything from a sword to a trident to a weighted net (use weapons tables from the Complete Fighter's Handbook for ideas), and there is always a magical effect released in tandem with the attack. This may be merely for flash and effect, or it may relate to the damage caused. For example, a sword might emit a shower of colored light when swung at an opponent, but inflict no extra damage, or a net might paralyze a trapped victim.
    The armor is always made of a metal known only to the reigar. It is harder than steel, with an Armor Class of 0 (not including any magical protections put into it by the creator). More often than not, the chest plate is decorated with an embossed head of the animal depicted by the shakti's form. As mentioned previously, this armor also bestows a special attack on its wearer. If the creature depicted is a panther, for instance, the attack might be a magical rending, performed by making a slashing motion with the arms. If the armor represents a dragon, the attack could be a simulation of that dragon's breath weapon, activated by placing the wrists together with the palms facing outward. These details are left up to the DM to create.
    A third command word returns the shakti to its dormant form from either of the other forms.
    Reigar shaktis work only for their creators. Should anyone else gain possession of a shakti by way of theft (not likely) or spoils of battle (less likely), that shakti is inoperable. However, it is possible that a reigar might create a gift-shakti for an adventurer who does something very, very important for the reigar â€“ like save his life, or provide transportation (see the "Ecology" section). This kind of gift-shakti, though, is far less powerful â€“ capable of making only one kind of transformation, no more than once per day: to vehicle, armor, or weapon (roll 1d6: 1-2 is vehicle, 3-4 is armor, 5-6 is weapon). Again, final say is up to the DM.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Legend has it that this race taught the elves everything they know about creating beautiful items â€“ and the elves forgot most of it. Supposedly they also taught the dwarves the same arts â€“ with the same results. Their love of creation for its own sake was also given to the tinker gnomes of Krynn , or so it is said. (However, the gnomes did not retain the reigar's love of beauty â€“ they seized on the creative process and took it to a technical extreme.) It is rumored that the reigar built the first spelljamming helm , and never repeated the act. Their mottoes are "Art for for art's sake" and "The ends always justify the means."
    While reigar are visually stunning to begin with, they are experts at heightening their already striking appearance.
    Hairstyles are an expression of individuality and, of course, artistic creativity. Men and women both may wear short or long tresses, highly decorated or intricately styled or both. They ornament themselves with fine jewelry of their own making, exquisite raiment of their own design. Facial makeup and tattoos for both sexes are not uncommon. This is not a function of class status or of wealth. It is merely a fact of reigar life â€“ one should always strive to outdo everyone else in all aspects of life, and do it with style, beauty, and elan. Their passion for artistic creativity extends to all aspects of their lives.
    Reigar are consummate users of magical spells, especially those that enhance the creative process. Items such as Nolzur's marvelous vestments and the lyre of building are particular favorites. In game terms, reigar are not limited to any particular school, but illusions are not likely to be in their repertoire â€“ reigar consider it gauche to create something that isn't real. Any spell can be considered to have artistic merit; it all depends on the time and place. For example, offensive spells like cloudkill afford the artistic caster a greater enjoyment of his opponents' deaths â€“ rather than frying instantly, as with a fireball , the poor wretches choke, writhe, gasp â€“ and beg. To a reigar, this is art at its best.
    The reigar as a race have been without a homeworld for millennia. The rumors reason: Their pursuit of art for art's sake led them to the total destruction of their world, using means of warfare never heard of before or since. The search for the ultimate artistic expression of war was carried out by reigar who were off-world in their esthetics , with no regard for those remaining on the ground. This is a classic example of the reigar code of conduct â€“ "Anything for art, nothing without style, and everyone for himself". Since this decimation of the race, and the destruction of the homeworld, the few remaining reigar have been wandering from sphere to sphere in search of artistic inspiration.
    The esthetics are biological in nature, having been created by reigar wizards in the time of the Master Stroke (see the "Esthetic" entry for details). It is not known for certain whether they can be propagated, or how this could be done should an esthetic be destroyed. Each esthetic will have no more than one reigar on board, but there is a crew of helots and lakshu to take care of the mundane tasks.
    The reigar are the source of many a legend in the universe. It is said that, in addition to teaching the elves and dwarves everything they know about craftsmanship, they are suppliers for the arcane . This is unlikely, as it implies repetition in creation, a bane to reigar. Art is not a repetitive process. A reigar may well have created the first spelljamming helm, but he would not have gone on to mass-produce them. That would quell his artistic expression and prevent him from pursuing the ultimate artistic experience.
    Another tale told about the reigar concerns their relationships with other races. The arcane, who look on all other races with total disdain, are said to bow to the reigar and do as the reigar tell them, without question. Similar rumors exist about the mindflayers , but these have been hotly denied by any mindflayer questioned on the subject. Still other legends would have the listener believe that the reigar created these races themselves, as an expression of their creativity and artistic license. Some go so far as to credit the reigar with the creation of humans â€“ denied as hotly by humans as the rumor about mindflayers is crushed by that species. The neogi refer to reigar as "damn liars". One race the reigar are never credited with creating is the clockwork horrors : Reigar detest these life forms as "bad art" and refer to them as "springheads".
  Ecology: |
    Depending on which rumors are believed, the reigar have either had a significant effect on their environment (aside from blowing up their own planet , of course) â€“ or they have done nothing but make pretty trinkets. The only unquestionable fact is that they did destroy their homeworld, and did so with weapons more powerful than can be imagined in present times. No one knows for certain whether that knowledge is retained by the reigar still in existence, but if it is, it could be very, very valuable to anyone, and dangerous in the extreme (especially in the wrong hands â€“ like neogi hands).
    Reigar are self-sufficient, obtaining their needs from their esthetics. These esthetics provide not only shelter and defenses, but nourishment and entertainment. Their crews of helots and lakshu are also sustained by the esthetics.
    It is possible that a reigar could be commissioned to create an item for an adventurer or a party but the cost would be astronomical (no pun intended). There is very little a normal adventurer could have that would interest a reigar (except transport; see the "Esthetic" entry), but flattery goes a long way toward successful negotiation.

  Description: |
    Rock hoppers are small humanoids about the size of gnomes . Their backs and the backs of their arms and legs are covered with very short, white hair. A much thicker, stiffer mane of hair grows across the top of their heads. Their noses are small, pointy, and covered by a hard shell, almost like a beak. Overall, they have a very owlish appearance.
    Typical rock hopper dress consists of a short leather skirt or kilt, a stiff vest, leather arm guards, and sandals or low boots. They always carry a variety of tools in a shoulder bag; they often wield knives or short swords.
    Rock hoppers are almost never encountered far from their skiffs . If they aren't traveling, they are making repairs, camped alongside, or gathering or exploring nearby.
  Combat: |
    Rock hoppers are not combative by nature. They generally do not attack strangers unless they clearly present a threat. Given an avenue of escape, rock hoppers usually choose discretion over valor. This is not out of cowardice, but simple, honest realization of the fact that they are weaker than most other wildspace travelers.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Rock hoppers live i asteroid fields. They are nomadic, so they rarely build permanent bases. When they do, they excavate rooms and tunnels into the asteroids, often including hangars for their skiffs.
    Rock hoppers build skiffs that they use to travel between the asteroids. These skiffs are not magical and do not carry spelljamming helms . Instead they are powered by propellers that operate from a turncrank attached to foot pedals. The pedalers sit on benches in much the same way that rowers sit in a Viking longboat. A system of gears transmits their effort to a central drive shaft that runs the length of the skiff to one or sometime two propellers at the rear. This propeller churns through the air inside the skiff's air envelope and moves the skiff forward. (Several scholars who have examined the rock hopper propulsion system have declared that it simply cannot work. These sages' only response to the fact that it obviously does work is that there is no reason why it should, and therefore it cannot.)
    Using their skiffs, rock hoppers travel from asteroid to asteroid (their skiffs carry too little air for longer voyages). Upon reaching a likely-looking spot, they raise their colorful awnings to shield themselves from the su , explore, maintain their skiffs, and hunt. Their main source of food is the herds of scavvers they presumably cultivated at some time in the past, but which now roam freely throughout the asteroids. The rock hoppers follow these herds on their migrations, pedaling out to hunt them with harpoons when the need arises. They hunt gray and night scavvers primarily for food, while they hunt brown scavvers for poison. They hunt void scavvers for sport and to protect themselves.
    Each rock hopper skiff carries a small cask of brown scavver poison for use in special circumstances. Primarily, this is reserved for those rare times when the rock hoppers encounter a kindori . Though they do not seek out these space whales, they have been known to kill kindori with poisoned harpoons in chases lasting days or even weeks.
  Ecology: |
    Sages do not believe that rock hoppers are native to the asteroids. Rather they were transplanted there long ago by some unknown agency. It is known that they will not trade with the arcane , and many sages believe that therein lies the secret of their condition.

  Description: |
    The rogue moon, a wandering monster the size of a whale , earned its name from the fact that it resembles a ball glowing in the dark. It dwells in the more remote regions of wildspace where, from a distance, it may be mistaken for a moo.
    The rogue moon has a roughly spherical body covered with scales that are orange to bright yellow. The scales form a thick, flexible armor. The rogue moon has two stalks and a large mouth on one side, and small openings regularly spaced about the rest of its body. The stalks are flexible and move constantly. The rogue moon's teeth are well adapted for a variety of different foods. Dozens of spikes lie flat on the scales, pointing away from the stalks and the mouth area.
  Combat: |
    Over the centuries, the rogue moon developed the uncanny ability to fool those who travel through wildspace. Unwary travelers and occasional monsters tend to move toward unknown sources of light. When the prey comes within several hundred yards, the rogue moon stops glowing and slowly drifts forward in the dark.
    If the rogue moon gets within 30 feet of a prey, it suddenly increases its size tenfold, erecting its spikes. As it enlarges, the rogue moon sucks smaller prey toward it, unless they make a successful Dexterity check (success means they managed to grab onto their ship). Victims automatically impale themselves on the spikes when falling, suffering 1d12 points of damage. They must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison at the beginning of the next round or remain paralyzed for 1d6 turns.
    Even a ship can be affected by the rogue moon's inhalation. Generally, a very large object, such as a ship, will hit the rogue moon one round after smaller objects, such as passengers. The rogue moon can avoid the ship by moving to one side. Otherwise, the impact causes 1 point of hull damage to the ship, 1d10 points of damage to all passengers (including those who impaled themselves on the moon's spikes), and 5d8 points of damage to the rogue moon itself.
    If attacked, the rogue moon uses its sharp teeth to fight back, inflicting 1d10 points of damage per successful attack. After combat, the rogue moon returns to its normal size, shakes off any paralyzed prey, and devours them.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The rogue moon is by nature a wandering monster. It lives in the darker regions of wildspace, moving about erratically. The rogue moon generally drifts in space, covering several hundred miles in a month.
    The rogue moons are solitary creatures. They do not mate, but have a peculiar way of reproducing. Every five years, a rogue moon exudes moonspawn, a thin, glowing cloud consisting of gases and microscopic eggs. The moonspawn does not dissipate into wildspace, as its cohesive properties enable it to stay together. The moonspawn then drifts away from the rogue moon. The smell of moonspawn can attract another rogue moon from thousands of miles away. When it reaches the moonspawn, the other rogue moon is fertilized. A year later, the "mother" casts away a dozen 1-HD rogue moons that immediately wander away in space. If anything or anyone else comes in contact with moonspawn, the moonspawn is wasted.
    Rogue moons can move by compressing air out of the openings in their scales. They can retain air found in occasional pockets of air in space or around large objects. This how rogue moons move in combat, or leave the surface of larger objects. If a rogue moon accidentally lands on a large ship, it would use the air on that ship to propel itself away. They also can "walk" by slowly moving their spikes in the manner of sea urchins. In total vacuum, they are stranded, helpless against attackers, and would eventually perish. Rogue moons do not need to breathe air.
  Ecology: |
    Rogue moons can live without food for months. If starving, they go into a state of lethargy that lasts up to ten years or until they sense something or someone approaching. Beyond ten years, rogue moons wither and die.
    The liver of rogue moons makes an excellent component for reverse gravity potions. The glands producing their venom can be used as an ingredient in various soporific drugs. (These glands are located at the base of the spikes, under the scales.) Treasure belonging to previous victims may be found inside the creatures, provided it was made of, or encased in, acid-resistant material.

  Description: |
    Scavvers are long, fishlike creatures of space , dominated by a since huge, humanlike eye at the leading edge of the head, and a wide, sweeping mouth. General body details such as number of fins vary depending on the origin of the creature, but their behavior and general coloring divide them into four basic groups: gray, brown, black and void scavver.
    Scavvers trail ships, asteroids , and larger creatures for droppings and refuse. They drift inside the air envelopes of these large bodies, so that as they move (often at high speeds) the scavvers move with them. The lesser scavvers are nuisances, their worst traits being that they suck up needed air. The larger scavvers are more deadly, in that they will often not wait for their meals to come to them. The eyes of the scavvers glow when they are awake.
  Combat: |
    The scavvers are built along the lines of minimum effort â€“ they are little more than gullets with enough brains to point themselves in the right direction. Combat details are given for each type.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Most are lazy by nature, such that they will be found at the trailing edge of a small celestial body or ship, along the plane of gravity. Most scavvers travel in packs, drifting between the planets waiting for a free meal. Unless repelled, they will follow a ship until a better or larger target presents itself. Many large cities, like the Rock of Bral , have a permanent scavver crew whose job it is to kill scavvers that come onto the Rock from arriving ships. The scavver crew is usually made up of ship captains and crews guilty of bringing these creatures in.
  Ecology: |
    In deep space, all scavvers can shut down their basic body functions, so that they require no air or food for long periods of time. In this fashion they drift until their paths collide with a passing ship or solar body.
    The scavvers tend to avoid large planets, since flying against gravity is too much work. They are found in every known sphere and in the phlogisto as well.
  Gray Scavver: |
    The gray scavvers are the smallest and the least dangerous of the lot, though they travel in large packs. The appearance of grays in a ship's air envelope is usually dangerous only because the grays will be using (and fouling) the air at a rate equivalent to an additional man per scavver. Usually they can be driven off by an armed party. The meat of gray scavvers is drab, but nutritious for those on long voyages.
  Brown Scavver: |
    The brown scavvers, which range from a sun-dappled gold to a dark rusty umber, are larger and only marginally brighter than the grays. The browns are pure scavengers, and will flee a particular bit of trash if challenged, only to return later. They have two abilities that make them less desirable than their smaller cousins. The first is that they can swallow a creature up to man-sized whole on an attack roll of 19 or 20. The gullet can hold a single man-sized creature (or two smaller than man-sized creatures).
    Once a victim is swallowed, the poisons in the gullet cause the victim to save vs. poison or die in three rounds. A victim who survives can attack from within the scavver, provided a short (less than 3') edged weapon is used. The scavver will take 1-6 points of such damage before returning its attacker to the outside world. Unfortunately, the scavver does not learn from experience, and will try to swallow the same reluctant piece of food several times before giving up or dying. One weaponless mage who was swallowed by a scavver returned to the living world by using a potion of growth , splitting the creature's gullet.
    The other ability of the brown scavver is a small cloud of poison gas evacuated from the gullet against an attacker. Outside the gullet, the droplets of poison are less potent (+3 on saving throws), but no less deadly (save or die within three rounds). The brown scavver can do this once per day to a single target in front of it. Brown scavvers cannot be affected by their own poison, though the poison of other species of scavvers can affect them.
    The flesh of the brown scavver is laced with its gullet poison; as a result, it is not eaten, but saved and used as poisoned bait for other scavvers. Most other space life will avoid dead browns, but gray scavvers will eat and die whenever the flesh is offered. A company of Shou dragonships has declared the brown to be perfectly palatable if prepared properly, and one captain swears to have served the scavver to the Emperor himself. Cynics believe that the Emperor had priests with detect , slow , and remove poiso spells on hand, and that the captain was run back out into space as a result.
  Night Scavver: |
    The night scavvers are generally black with spots of white along their length. With its dark flesh and white spangles, the night scavver fades in with the background of the void. This omnivorous version of the common scavver has the distressing habit of not waiting for food to come to it. It will sneak onto the deck of a ship and cruise about looking for loose food and other items. As a result, the belly of the night scavver is often littered with small but valuable debris, ranging from a few gold coins to perhaps a magical ring. The DM can determine the belly hoard of the scavver by using a randomly determined treasure type from J to U (roll 1d12), with a 1% chance of a magical item.
    The night scavver is relentless in its quest for food, once committed, and while one will not attack an obviously crowded ship, it will slip on during the night watches and refuse to budge from its new location, even if threatened with superior physical force.
    The night scavver can swallow creatures of up to man-sized in the same fashion as the brown scavver (an attack roll of 19 or 20). However, it lacks the gullet poison of the brown that pacifies that type's prey. The night scavver makes up for this lack by its unusual reaction to efforts by swallowed creatures to carve themselves out of its belly. It brings the victim forward to its mouth, chews on it a while (one attack at +4), then sends it back down again. The interior wall of the night scavver is AC 7, and the night scavver will use this "cud-chewing" instinct whenever it takes any internal damage.
    Night scavvers are considered delicious, and crews will often use open fires on the deck to roast them in celebration of planet-fall or a good voyage. As a result, they are considered a good omen at the end of a trip.
  Void Scavver: |
    Void scavvers are jet black except for their single eye. They are the most dangerous of the breed, as they are man-eaters. While the other scavvers will be content with digesting a few kitchen scraps, the void scavvers will go after the cook. These creatures are solitary and have a fine, animal cunning for preying on their targets. They will find a lair hidden from most of the guards on a ship and use that as their base, treating the rest of the ship as their own personal icebox.
    The void scavver can swallow up to large-sized creatures, and will do so on an attack roll of 18, 19, or 20. It has gullet poison similar to the brown scavver, but lacks the ability to expel it into the air. Its interior is AC 5, and it is possible for a victim to cut his way out with small hand-held weapons.
    The void scavver is relentless, and will strip a ship clean if it can get away with it. It will batter down doors and hatches to reach its prey. Its sight, touch, and smell are superb, such that invisible creatures can be detected and attacked by the scavver without penalty. Legends tell of rare gargantuan void scavvers attacking full ships, ripping the hulls apart in search of food.
    The void scavver is a solitary hunter, and will drive off other scavvers that threaten its prey. The void scavver will attack any of the other scavver types, and it will kill but not eat the brown scavver.

  Description: |
    The highly militaristic scro are a violent goblinoid race that has only recently appeared. They are still rarely encountered, but if present trends continue, wildspace travellers will unfortunately see much more of them.
    The scro resemble musclebound orcs , fully armored and armed to the teeth. Scro have the orc's characteristic pig-like snout; however, the scro stand proud and erect, and their high foreheads resemble humanity's. Scro have large canine teeth that they sharpen to a fine point; they decorate teeth and ears with tribal mini-totems. Scro eyes appear huma , but they glow a sickly phosphorescent green in dim light. Hide color ranges from slate gray, burnt orange, light tan, and moss green, to jet black and even, in rare cases, albino white.
    Scro armor is well oiled, well maintained studded leather with each stud filed to a sharp point. The armor is always jet black, though the studs are painted different colors. Their numerous weapons are just as well maintained. Scro often complete their wardrobe with a night-blue cloak.
    Scro carry no standards, but each scro wears an insignia that identifies its tribe. This is worn either as a shoulder patch or on the left side of the chest.
    The scro speak a distant variant of the orcish tongue. Curiously, some speak fluent elvish, for they have fanatically preserved the language of their worst enemies â€“ so that when the scro slaughter the elve race, the marauding humanoids can tell their victims, in their own tongue, who is doing this to them.
  Combat: |
    The scro live for combat. They have raised it to the highest form of expression in their society. They fight easily in any environment and are well disciplined. Though the scro can be just as bloodthirsty as orcs, they have tempered their savagery with pragmatism and strategic and tactical cunning. Scro actually obey most of the civilized rules of warfare and do not fire on messengers or truce-bearers.
    For every four scro encountered, there is one sergeant. For every ten scro encountered, there is one captain and one war priest. Only the largest gatherings of scro include an Almighty Leader.
    Scro use the following weapons: longsword and dagger (15% of the time); scimitar (10%); arquebus and hand axe (25%); arquebus and starwheel (5%); spear and hand axe (15%); polearm and dagger (10%); shortbow and shortsword (15%); and crossbow and battleaxe (5%). Captains and bodyguards may also possess a starwheel firearm (75% chance). Almighty Leaders almost always carry a starwheel. War priests, multi-classed 5th-level cleric/mages, have one weapon with an enchantment between +2 and +4, plus 1d4 miscellaneous magical items usable by priests and wizards.
    Sergeants and war priests get three melee attacks every two rounds; captains and Almighty Leaders get two melee attacks per round. These attacks are usable only with melee weapons or fists, not missile weapons or firearms. Optionally, scro with two melee weapons may be trained in two-weapon fighting (see The Complete Fighter's Handbook for details).
    The vast majority (95%) of scro warriors specialize in unarmed combat, which gives them two punches per round at +1 to hit, doing 1d3 damage per punch plus Strength bonus. (Most adult scro have at least Strength 16 and Constitution 15.) In addition, some (30%) scro use a spiked leather glove that does an extra +1 hp damage in unarmed combat attacks.
    Scro armor spikes cause 1d4 damage to any foe that the scro smashes against. Some nasty scro coat their armor's studs and spike with a Type D poison (5% chance); the poison's onset takes one minute and does 30 hp damage (save vs. poison for 2d6 damage).
    If all else fails, a scro bites with its powerful teeth for 1d3 damage. If a scro kills an opponent with its teeth, the triumphant warrior affixes a small gem or bauble on one of its oversized canines. It then takes a tooth from the opponent and puts it on a necklace called a toregkh . This necklace is prized as a totem of strength. If it is stolen, the warrior flies into a berserk rage against the offender (+2 to hit and damage, +4 penalty to AC, number of attacks per round doubled).
    Strangely, the scro are notably articulate. They prefer to begin combat by shouting long, literate insults against their opponents, to show that they hold their enemies in contempt. The mere sight of a goblinoid spouting offensive alliterations might disorient the most battle-hardened veteran long enough to let the scro gain initiative in combat.
    Direct sunlight does not affect scro combat ability.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Scro live in a regimented society, based on a complex system of laws and customs that call for unswerving loyalty and obedience. Each scro is a valued member of society and has a duty to fulfill.
    Leaders are respected and obeyed unless they show obvious cowardice in battle. In that case, it is the strongest scro's duty to overthrow the coward's authority and lead the troops in glorious battle.
    The scro homeworld's location is unknown. Thus far, they have seldom ventured into civilized areas, preferring to keep out of sight until they are truly ready. On the homeworld, Dukagsh , the scro live in well-planned, spartan cities with stout towers, strong fortresses, and efficient shipyards. Though the place is no garden spot, neither is it smoky, ugly, or garbage-strewn. Each city has 10,000 to 100,000 scro.
    Each of Dukagsh's 24 tribes is led by an Almighty Leader. The entire planet is ruled by the Ultimate High Overlord, a 16 HD scro who is guarded by 24 Captains, one from each tribe. Each tribe has a social rank, with those of lower rank subordinate to the higher tribes.
    Scro soldiers train in non-weapon proficiencies and normally have three of these skills: Armorer, Blindfighting, Endurance, land-based Riding, Reading/Writing, Rope Use, Running, Tracking, and Weaponsmithing. Sergeants have four of these proficiencies; captains have five; war priests have four, plus Healing, Herbalism, Religion, and Spellcraft.
    Scro are not interested in conquering the multiverse. Their sole purpose is to drive all groundling human, demi-human, and humanoid races out of wildspace for good. The war priests see this, not planetary conquest, as their holy mission. As for the races native to wildspace...well, the scro will need slave labor, and those pitiful races will do quite nicely. The scro are merely waiting for the right moment to strike.
  Ecology: |
    The scro have an "us against the whole multiverse" philosophy that is sure to produce plenty of enemies when they make their presence felt. Thus far, the scro know much about the other space-faring races, but those races are unaware of the scro's existence, save for a few rumors from unreliable sources.
    Like their orcish forebears, scro are fecund. They produce litters of 1d4+1 offspring, most with an excellent chance of survival beyond infancy. Unlike their orcish ancestors, the scro live for an average of 80 years.
  History: |
    The scro trace their ancestry back to the orc tribes that fought and lost the Unhuman Wars . Some crews and troops of the few surviving orc vessels made their way to a remote but habitable planet and settled down. This ragtag band was led by a huge orc called Dukagsh, who appointed himself the first Almighty Leader.
    By orc standards, Dukagsh was a visionary. He recognized that the orcs lost the Unhuman Wars because of their one-dimensional ideas and outmoded tactics. Brutality for its own sake had gotten them nowhere. Dukagsh realized that the orcs needed to fight in an organized way, and that each soldier must realize his full potential.
    In the ensuing years, Dukagsh whipped his people into shape, making sure that they learned fighting, survival, and even culture. To make sure no one forgot who caused the orcs' misfortune, each orc had to learn fluent elvish.
    Sometime, the orcs salvaged equipment from drifting space junk, the remains of human, elven, dwarve , and goblinoid ships from the Unhuman War battles. Occasionally they found books, and Dukagsh made his people read them.
    Before Dukagsh died, he declared that his people were on the path to success. The old ways were dead, he claimed, and a new race was born, a race that was more than any orc could ever be. He named them the scro.
    At his death, his grateful followers named their homeworld in his honor. Dukagsh's tomb now floats over the homeworld's north pole, so that the deceased leader may look down on his people and watch their progress.

  Description: |
    The shivaks are only found aboard the Spelljammer , and they are constructed (grown) in a manner similar to the smalljammers . In the shivaks' case, they are constructed in the shivak terminal (Area #15) rather than in the gardens (Area #2) like the smalljammers. The shivaks grow in pods out of the lifeless corridors.
    When shivaks are destroyed or wear out, more are constructed. Those that are not immediately needed are kept in storage, where they are maintained on small amounts of energy from the ship. There are about 500 shivaks on board the ship at any one time.
    Shivaks resemble headless ellipsoids that have limbs. The limbs are arranged in such a manner that varieties of shivaks resemble various species aboard the ship. The surface of a shivak appears to be covered by a thick gray leather. However, this leatherlike exterior extends fully to the core of a shivak - in other words, shivaks lack organs in the known sense. The limbs are made of similar material, and they are what allow the shivaks to maneuver. (Shivaks move forward, backward, and sideways at will, much as if they were on rollers.)
    Each variety of shivak also has a special attack form that it may use at will as described below.
  Common Shivaks: |
    The types of common shivak include the following:
    Humanoid - This shivak has humanoid limbs that consist of two stumplike legs and two multihinged arms, each arm ending in a delicate bundle of tapered coils. The coils allow the humanoid shivak to perform delicate work, but the humanoid's chief attribute is incredible strength. At will, they may raise their Strength to that of fire giant level, gaining +4 to hit and +10 to damage.
    Centaurian - The centaurian shivak's elliptical body is horizontal rather than upright. It is supported by four horselike limbs, and it has a set of multijointed humanoid arms mounted at what is presumed to be the forward end of the shivak. The centaurian's chief attribute is speed, and it can increase its movement to 24 at will.
    Beholderia - The beholderian shivak is a floating egg shape that has a bundle of tentacles nestled around its crown. It does not have the eyes of a beholder , but its coils are incredibly strong (STR = 19). More importantly, this shivak can fly at its normal movement speed, and it has an MC of A.
    Serpentine - The serpentine shivak is a narrow ellipsoid that has an extended tail, which the shivak uses to coil around its opponents. It constricts its target, then crawls off with the creature still in its coils. The serpentine shivak has the ability to compress its body as well, allowing it to squeeze into spaces no more than 1 foot across in pursuit of its opponent.
    Spideria - Also called neogian , this shivak is a horizontal ellipsoid much like the centaurian's body. This shivak's body, however, is supported by eight movable legs and is slung upward like a spider. Spiderian shivaks have the ability to spit a paralyzing poison up to 20 feet away. This poison can freeze an opponent for 1-3 rounds - enough time for the spiderian (and the other shivaks as well) to overwhelm and remove the intruder.
    Enigmatic - The enigmatic shivak is a mystery because it does not resemble any of the currently known major races of space . This shivak has a triform body, with three stumplike limbs and three arms coiled like rope and ending in trilateral "hands." While it resembles both the xor and the triphegs , neither of those races have been known to have had a major impact in space outside their home worlds . The enigmatic shivak has a nasty ability in that it may produce a shocking grasp (as per the spell) for 2-12 points of additional damage when grappling with an opponent. This is only used to shock its opponents into submission.
  Combat: |
    The shivaks in battle fight as a unified whole, regardless of their appearance. Their tactics are generally straightforward, consisting of overwhelming their opponents with numbers, then carting them off. Their main function seems to be to keep trespassers out of areas of the Spelljammer that are off limits.
    The shivaks are apparently connected to both the ship and to each other, for attacking one shivak typically brings others in quick succession (usually 1-8 additional shivaks will appear 3-6 rounds after the initial attack).
    The shivaks have been given only limited orders, however, and they will only attack if they are attacked, if a creature is in a restricted area, or if they are prevented from doing their normal tasks, which include food delivery and dismantling ships. Otherwise they tend to leave the other races on board alone and are in turn left alone by other races.
    The shivaks are immune to illusion and light-based attacks. They cannot be poisoned, polymorphed , or paralyzed, nor may they be charmed or otherwise affected by enchantment spells, including sleep . They are immune to their own attack forms, including those of other shivaks.
    The shivaks do not see in the traditional sense, but rather they emanate a continual detect life . Otherwise invisible living creatures stand out brightly to them, as do those masked by illusion spells. They know the buildings and warrens of the ship by heart and can move smoothly around inanimate objects. However, animate, unliving creatures (such as undead , golems, and clockwork horrors ) are invisible to them. They cannot attack what they cannot see, though they may flail around at -4 to hit.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The shivaks have no real society and are little more than extensions of the will of the Spelljammer itself. Unless specifically commanded otherwise by the captain, they will continue to perform their normal duties.
    When under the control of the captain, they will respond to his or her orders as long as those orders do not directly contradict the shivaks' functions. (For instance, the captain cannot order the shivaks to not attack a trespasser found in the warrens.)
  Ecology: |
    The shivaks are "grown" in the shivak terminal, far from the light of the gardens, in great pods hanging from the wall. Unlike the smalljammers, the shivaks' only requirement for development is the presence of a spelljamming helm , which will create 1-10 new shivaks. Any spelljamming helms that are found will be taken back to the terminal for future use.
    It takes only a few days for the terminal to create these shivaks once it has a new helm. The process is similar to the creation of the smalljammers upon the arrival of a new captain. The spelljamming helms, however, are consumed in the process and cannot be regained.
  Guardian Shivak: |
    The guardian shivak is the largest of the shivaks and is found only in the control room. (The control room is an area that appears on the Spelljammer only when a prospective captain comes on board; the area randomly shifts position throughout the ship and is seldom found in the same place twice in a row. The adventurer must defeat the guardian shivak to bond with the ship and become captain.)
    The guardian shivak is built to encompass the worst fears of the previous captain. As such, it strongly resembles the physical form those fears take (as opposed to the elliptical shape of the other shivaks). The current guardian shivak resembles a gigantic mind flayer . It is equipped with a psionic blast similar to that of a mind flayer.
    The guardian shivak is made of the same leathery material as are the common shivaks, however, and it too has no apparent internal organs. The guardian has all the resistances and immunities of the other shivaks.
    The guardian shivak exists only when an ultimate helm is carried on board the Spelljammer . This shivak is developed specifically for the purpose of challenging the possessor of the helm.
    If the helm is destroyed or carried off the ship, the guardian shivak is absorbed back into the ship itself. It will reform each time an ultimate helm is present, and it will continue to be in the form that encompasses the fears of the previous captain, regardless of how many times the guardian shivak is called upon to appear.

  Description: |
    Silatics are amorphous blobs, 5-7' in diameter, that eat metal. Continuously shifting and quivering, they use their two pseudopods to test substances for edibility. The silatic's diet consists solely of the metal they are made of. For example, a platinum silatic eats only platinum. Silatics innately detect the metal they eat within a 100' range.
    Silatics hide well, for they can stretch as thin as 1" thick. They need no air to survive and prefer wildspace to planets . In wildspace they are almost graceful, fanning their thinned bodies to move slowly. As soon as gravity takes hold, though, gracefulness disappears; their pseudopods pull them along the ground.
  Combat: |
    The silatic's two pseudopods administer bludgeoning damage of 1d6+4. Each adult silatic's pseudopod can extend to 50'. They attack only if disturbed while eating or prevented from feeding. Usually, one pseudopod remains attached to the food while the other attacks an opponent. If injured, the silatic detaches from the food source and attacks the offender with both pseudopods.
    There are three known types of silatics: gold, platinum, and iron. (A fourth, silver, is rumored.) Each has a special attack:
    Iro â€“ +2 bonus to damage; high magic resistance.
    Gold â€“ moves faster than other silatics, gaining one extra attack per round.
    Platinum â€“ +3 bonus to damage; also, the platinum silatic coats its pseudopod with acid. If it hits, the character takes an additional 2d8 damage (save vs. poison for half damage).
    A silatic eats by attaching a pseudopod to its meal, excreting a liquid that dissolves the metal, and absorbing it through the skin. It takes three rounds to administer the liquid and three to absorb the liquefied metal. The liquid is harmless to living beings. Metal of the silatic's type saves vs. acid at -5. Metal not of the silatic's type saves at -2.
    If a silatic senses metal within a wooden-hulled ship, it first tries to sneak aboard. If this fails, it batters a hole in the ship near the metal inside. Against metal ships, a silatic inflicts 1 hull point per turn; against wood, it inflicts normal combat damage.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Silatics are solitary, avoiding other beings by hinding in "uninhabitable" places. Silatics of the same type exhibit instant hostility and fight to the death.
    Gravs and most space miners kill silatics on sight. Residents of inhabited worlds hunt down silatics relentlessly. Once a gold silatic got into the gold reserves of a major city, reproduced, and soon dozens were oozing around, searching for more gold to devour. The entire city's economy collapsed because gold became too scarce â€“ all because of one hungry silatic.
  Ecology: |
    Silatics have no spelljamming ability. To move from world to world, they stow away on ships, often on the outer hull.
    When a silatic absorbs enough metal (around 100 lbs), it seeks out an uninhabited area and splits in two. The two new silatics, each 3Â½' wide, are dazed and instinctively move in opposite directions. Five hours after splitting, they regain their senses and search for food. If the reproduction occurs in a confined space, the two silatics fight to the death upon regaining their senses.
    If a silatic is killed, only the metal eaten in the last week can be recovered (usually 1d10 lbs per Hit Die). All other material dissolves into a jelly-like substance.

  Description: |
    All skeletons are magically animated undead monsters, created as guardians or warriors by powerful evil wizards and priests.
    Skeletons appear to have no ligaments or musculature which would allow movement. Instead, the bones are magically joined together during the casting of an animate dead spell. Skeletons have no eyes or internal organs.
    Skeletons can be made from the bones of humans and demihumans, animals of human size or smaller, or giant humanoids like bugbears and giants.
  Combat: |
    Man-sized humanoid skeletons always fight with weapons, usually a rusty sword or spear. Because of their magical nature, they do not fight as well as living beings and inflict only 1-6 points of damage when they hit. Animal skeletons almost always bite for 1-4 points of damage, unless they would obviously inflict less (i.e., skeletal rats should inflict only 1-2 points, etc.). Monster skeletons, always constructed from humanoid creatures, use giant-sized weapons which inflict the same damage as their living counterparts but without any Strength bonuses.
    Skeletons are immune to all sleep , charm , and hold spells. Because they are assembled from bones, cold-based attacks also do skeletons no harm. The fact that they are mostly empty means that edged or piercing weapons (like swords, daggers, and spears) inflict only half damage when employed against skeletons. Blunt weapons, with larger heads designed to break and crush bones, cause normal damage against skeletons. Fire also does normal damage against skeletons. Holy water inflicts 2-8 points of damage per vial striking the skeleton.
    Skeletons are immune to fear spells and need never check morale, usually being magically commanded to fight to the death. When a skeleton dies, it falls to pieces with loud clunks and rattles.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Skeletons have no social life or interesting habits. They can be found anywhere there is a wizard or priest powerful enough to make them. Note that some neutral priests of deities of the dead or dying often raise whole armies of animated followers in times of trouble. Good clerics can make skeletons only if the dead being has granted permission (either before or after death) and if the cleric's deity has given express permission to do so. Otherwise, violating the eternal rest of any being or animal is something most good deities disapprove of highly.
    Skeletons have almost no minds whatsoever, and can obey only the simplest one- or two-phrase orders from their creators. Skeletons fight in unorganized masses and tend to botch complex orders disastrously. It is not unheard of to find more than one type of skeleton (monsters with animals, animals with humans) working together to protect their master's dungeon or tower.
  Ecology: |
    Unless the skeleton's remains are destroyed or scattered far apart, the skeleton can be created anew with the application of another animate dead spell. Rumors of high-level animate dead spells which create skeletons capable of reforming themselves to continue fighting after being destroyed have not been reliably confirmed.

  Description: |
    Skullbirds are large carrion birds of wildspace . A bad reputation follows these birds. Sailors consider the sight of a skullbird a sign that someone aboard ship will die soon.
    The birds are named for their gruesome heads, which appear to be bird skulls covered with a layer of shiny black skin stretched tight. Their glittering dark eyes are hidden deep in the recessed sockets, and their beaks are jet black and needle-sharp. Skullbirds are covered with oily black feathers and exude an oily, charnel odor. Their talons are like razors.
    Skullbirds have no language, but have two distinct calls: an irritating, high-pitched screech when they find live food, and an ominous, bass croaking when they find carrion.
  Combat: |
    Though the birds prefer to eat carrion, since it puts up no fight, they unhesitatingly attack live prey if they have not had a decent meal in several days (50% chance).
    Skullbirds attack with their two sets of sharp talons, each doing 1d8 damage. If the prey is still moving, they try to finish it off with a swift stroke of their razor-like beaks, inflicting 3d4 damage.
    Whenever a skullbird attacks a victim who weighs less than 200 pounds, it tries to snatch up its prize and fly away to its foul nest. To do so, the skullbird must hit the victim with both claws in the same melee round. The talons have an effective Strength of 17. The victim is allowed a Strength check to escape; failure means the bird swoops up with the victim at top speed. If the prey struggles for more than one round, the skullbird drops the victim, in hopes that the falling damage will finish it off.
    Skullbirds secrete an oily substance that keeps them comfortable while flying in space. The oil is slippery; any attempt to grapple with the bird takes a -4 penalty. This oil is also responsible for the creature's low AC, since weapons seem to slip off the bird.
    The oil, however, is highly flammable, giving the skullbirds a -4 penalty when saving vs. fire-based attacks, and +2 hp per die of fire damage. Waving torches or other open flames around a skullbird for one round forces a morale check.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Skullbirds nest in floating wrecks of spelljamming vessels, or in the decomposing bodies of huge, dead, wildspace creatures. They travel in flocks and have no leaders. Skullbirds are not territorial.
    Once every three months, a female skullbird lays 1d4 eggs. Ugly, almost skeletal chicks hatch from the eggs and begin croaking instantly, demanding to be fed. The sound is reminiscent of a group of bullfrogs. There is a 25% chance of finding skullbird eggs in a nest. They are not edible.
    The oily feathers of the skullbird also trap air most efficiently, giving the birds a full day's supply of air. They do require air to survive in wildspace.
    The skullbird is a bird of ill omen. Sailors shun them, and shun anyone foolish enough to wear anything made from part one of the birds. If a ship encounters skullbirds outside their lair, the encounter begins with the birds flying out of nowhere and trying to perch on the ship's masts. This is considered the worst possible omen, a sign that the ship will soon be destroyed. Fast-moving characters get one round to try to drive the birds away from the masts; if they succeed the birds may attack instead (50% chance).
    Average or Green crews who see the skullbirds roosting on their ships undergo an immediate morale check at -1 penalty. Failure indicates that the sailors immediately panic, some scampering below decks, others jumping off the ship. They remain panicked until the birds are driven off. More experienced crews need not check morale, but they make morale checks in later battles at the same penalty.
  Ecology: |
    The only positive ecological contribution skullbirds make is their pursuit of their favorite food, feesu.

sky_scavver:
  Summary:
    The sky scavver is a creature from the Spelljammer campaign setting.

    Size: G (100')
    Morale: Elite (13)
    XP Value: 12,000
  Description: |
    Apart from their size, sky scavvers are identical in structure to the other five known species of scavvers : long, fishlike creatures, dominated by a single huge, glowing huma -like eye at the leading edge of the head, with a wide, sweeping mouth full of sharp carnivore's teeth. The sheer size of the sky scavver is enough to set it apart from its space-dwelling brethren, however: the average mature specimen is about 100 feet in length.
    Sky scavvers fly through the air of the third layer of Alabeth using a modified form of the more well-known scavvers' innate spelljamming ability. They are pure predators, living off the many aerial creatures that occupy the third layer of the might air world. While they will eat virtually anything that crosses their path, their favorite food is the holbags - the gigantic floating gas bags native to Alabeth's third layer.
  Combat: |
    The sky scavver's primary attack is a bite from their huge, tooth-studded mouth. Such an attack inflicts 4d10 hit points of damage. The mouth is big enough to allow the creatures to bite even something as large as a spelljamming vessel, inflicting 1d4 hull points of damage. In addition, an adult sky scavver can swallow whole any creature of size L or smaller, and will do so on an attack roll of 13 or more. The sky scavver has a gullet poison similar to the brown scavver - victims must save vs. poison or die in three rounds - but lacks the ability to expel it into the air. Its interior is AC 5, and it is possible for a victim to cut his way out with small handheld weapons. The bellies of sky scavvers will sometimes contain undigestible residue from earlier meals: metals, stones (including gems) and the like. Sky scavvers can also deal a punishing tail-slap like that of the kindori . This attack inflicts 3d10 hit points of damage, or 1d3 hull points.
    The sky scavver's most dangerous attack however is its ability to fire a powerful lightning bolt from its single eye. This bolt has a maximum range of 250 yards, and inflicts 2d20 hit points, or 2-4 hull points, of damage (save vs. spells - or lightning, for ships - for half damage).
    Sky scavvers are totally immune to electrical-based attacks. Other attacks inflict normal damage. Although they have some intelligence, their minds are sufficiently different from those of demihumans that they are totally immune to charm , illusions and other mind-affecting magic.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Sky scavvers usually operate as solitary predators. When they're attacking holbags, however, they hunt in packs of 1-4. They are as ferocious as the void scavver, but won't kill other members of their species who try to "muscle in" on their prey. There is a strongly-defined "pecking order" within a sky scavver pack, however, with the strongest individuals always feeding first.
    The intelligence of sky scavvers is sufficient to let them plan the best manner of attack against larger opponents. (The technique these creatures favor against immature holbags is discussed in the section describing these great gas bags.) Many people who have seen sky scavvers operate claim that their intelligence is actively malign.
  Ecology: |
    Sky scavvers are simple-minded predators. They have no natural enemies as such - that is, creatures that feed on them. Attacks against mature holbags are highly dangerous, however, and lead to the deaths of many sky scavvers. Since the holbags eat nothing but aerial plankton, the bodies of dead scavvers simply fall into the lower layers of A1abeth's atmosphere - presumably to be devoured by other creatures.

  Description: |
    Sleeks are ermine-like mammals with bright, black eyes. Antennae on their muzzles aid them in gauging both the size and distance of their prey. Though independent, they occasionally seek huma and demihuman companionship.
  Combat: |
    The sleek's speed and silent motion make it all but invisible (surprise on 1-5 on 1d6). In combat against man-sized or larger adversaries, the sleek uses its antennae to sense vital areas in an opponent, then attacks with its claws and razor sharp teeth. The sleek's claws do 1d4 points of damage. Man-sized or larger targets suffer 2d6 points of damage.
    A roll of 20 indicates that the sleek has opened a major blood vessel, causing a halfling-sized or larger victim to lose 1d6 hp per minute through bleeding. First aid, such as a tourniquet or direct pressure, stops this hp loss, as does healing magic. Smaller targets must save vs. death. Failure means the victim dies immediately, its spinal cord severed.
    Their fast metabolism, coupled with an extremely powerful and efficient digestive tract, renders sleeks immune to poison. This also lets them consume poisonous or exotic flesh â€“ even flesh golems are not safe!
    Sleeks sometimes act in concert against large prey. This ability to cooperate, combined with their berserker-like battle frenzy (+4 to hit), makes them formidable enemies to shipboard "pests".
  Habitat/Society: |
    Sleeks inhabit cargo holds and small ship passageways. If coaxed with food they can be domesticated (30% chance).
    Their large, bright eyes, silvery-white fur, and sensitive antennae mark them as onetime cave dwellers, but their adaptations pose no handicap to them in the light. Sleeks mate for life, producing litters of 1d4 young once a year. A family of sleeks may occupy a "territory", but conflict between sleek territories is rare.
    In lean times sleeks also exact "tribute" from ship crews. Instead of helping themselves to foodstuffs, they play tricks, steal clothes and precious items, and generally make nuisances of themselves until the crew formally offers food. Simply leaving food for them is not good enough; the "insulted" sleeks demand a show of submission. For instance, the captain must roll on his or her back in full view of the sleeks. Only then is the sleeks' honor satisfied. This behavior earns them the name "pirate-masters".
  Ecology: |
    Sleeks live about 20 years. Young stay with their parents for two years, whereupon they leave to establish territories of their own. Those individuals who adopt humans remain with them for life as staunch allies.

  Description: |
    Slinkers are small, vaguely bird-like creatures. They stand approximately eight inches high on two hind legs. Their forelegs are short and usually held close to the body when the slinkers move, but these are also used to hold bits of food and handle small items. The slinkers' heads form out of the fronts of their bodies without the nicety of any appreciable necks. They have two closely set eyes on either side of their small beaks.
    Their bodies are sparely covered with thin, stiff hair that ranges from light red to brown to gray to jet black. Some slinkers also appear to be white with red, brown, and black spots. Some naturalists believe these were once domesticated slinkers that have returned to a wild state, though what purpose they served domestically is unknown. A short, hairless tail (approximately three inches long) trails behind each slinker.
  Combat: |
    Slinkers are nearly helpless in any sort of fight with a human-sized creature. Thus they almost always flee upon catching sight of a huma or demihuman. They do not attack large creatures unless there is nowhere to run.
    If backed into a corner and forced to fight, slinkers charge as one and try to swarm over their antagonizer. Individually, slinker bites are painful but not very dangerous. When attacking as a group, however, they can cause serious injuries to rash characters. When slinkers attack, every slinker in the pack attacks the same target and keeps attacking that target until either it or the slinkers are dead.
    If a group of PCs corners a pack of slinkers and the slinkers fight, they charge the closest character, clambering over him and burrowing under clothing and armor. The character being attacked must roll a successful Dexterity check to avoid being knocked down by the rush. Furthermore, if the number of attacking slinkers is higher than the character's Dexterity score, add the difference as a penalty to the Dexterity check die roll. (If, for example, 18 slinkers rush a character with Dexterity 12, the character must add 6 to his Dexterity check die roll.) Once this initial check is made, regardless of its outcome, the character doesn't have to roll another Dexterity check again unless another pack of slinkers attacks him. If the character is knocked down, usual attack modifiers for a prone target apply (+4 bonus for the slinkers' attack rolls).
  Habitat/Society: |
    Slinkers live in packs of up to 800 individuals. Presumably, the strongest or meanest slinker holds sway over the others, though what sort of authority it exercises is open to debate. These packs are rarely seen assembled in one place. In most cases, no more than 20 slinkers are ever encountered at once.
    Slinkers are primarily scavengers, and so they prefer to live in areas where food and refuse is plentiful and there are lots of places to hide. They are quite common in cities, especially in the slums and warehouse districts of asteroid citadels (like those usually found around dockyards).
  Ecology: |
    In most respects, slinkers compete with rats and other vermin for their ecological niche. The most significant differences between them are that slinkers do not typically carry disease, and slinkers have unusually fast metabolisms, high respiratory rates, and short reproductive cycles.
    If slinkers get aboard a spelljamming vessel, they begin reproducing themselves at an alarming rate. Every week, the slinker population aboard ship increases by 10 percent. This can become a serious problem if the slinkers are not controlled, because they eat a lot of food and breathe a lot of air. In one day, five slinkers eat as much food and breathe as much air as a human crew member. As their population increases, so does the rate at which they consume the ship's food supply and foul its air.
    To use slinkers to their maximum effect, DMs are recommended to use Method 2 for keeping track of air quality aboard the PCs' vessel (as described on page 12 of the Concordance of Arcane Space [TSR 1049]). This is particularly effective if players are allowed to keep track of their own air and food supply while the DM keeps his own, secret record that accounts for the slinkers' presence.

  Description: |
    Sluk is wildspace seaweed, with the same ship-miring ability as sargasso seaweed in planetary seas. An unintelligent parasite, it feeds on magical energy.
    Sluk is a dark blue weed with small silver nodules in its leaves. It drifts in 50' long, stringy clumps called "beds", waiting for ships to run into it. Its coloration acts as near-perfect camouflage in wildspace (only 5% chance that lookouts see it). In the phlogisto , the plant is easy to spot.
  Combat: |
    If a spellcaster or anyone carrying three or more magical items falls into a sluk bed, the seaweed wraps itself around the victim. If it scores a hit, the sluk contracts with Strength 18 as it leeches magical energy, inflicting 1d6 damage per round. Draining effects on magical items are described below.
    Sluk can mire spelljamming vessels. Each 50 square feet of sluk bed can stop five tons of vessel; the bed's area is 2d10Ã—50 square feet.
    If the vessel is moving at spelljamming speeds when it runs into a sluk bed big enough to stop it, the ship immediately decelerates to tactical speed, requiring all aboard to make a Dexterity check or lose their balance and fall. A vessel travelling at tactical speed through a sluk bed gradually slows to a halt, losing Â¼ of its original speed and maneuverability each round until it stops.
    Once a vessel stops in a sluk bed, the only way to get moving again is to chop away the strands. This takes 1d6+3 rounds.
    Sluk is completely immune to magic, except for cold-based spells. Magical cold instantly causes the plant to shrivel up and flake off. Other spells merely nourish the sluk. If a total of 10 spell levels are cast at the sluk, it reproduces as detailed below.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Sluk is attracted to sources of magic and moves towards them much as a groundling sunflower turns to face the su.
  Ecology: |
    Sluk reproduces by adhering to a trapped spelljamming hull and bleeding its magical energy. The hull must be wood; metal hulls are immune to the bleeding, though they are still trapped. Subtract the trapped vessel's SR from 10; the result is the number of rounds (minimum 1) the sluk must hold the ship motionless to reproduce. Thus, a vessel with SR 4 lets the plant reproduce in six rounds. Sluk can only bleed motionless ships.
    In reproducing, the sluk doubles the size of its patch, possibly miring the ship even deeper in the bed. At DMâ€™s option, the crew must spend 1d6 extra rounds cutting away strands.
    Drain effects: The sluk temporarily reduces a trapped spelljammer's SR by 1 per round (minimum 1). Ignore this temporary reduction when figuring how long the sluk takes to reproduce; always use the ship's original SR instead. The ship regains 1 SR per hour once it escapes from the sluk. Once a ship is reduced to SR 1, it no longer feeds the sluk enough energy to permit reproduction. At the DM's discretion, spelljamming helms may lose their power permanently after months in the sluk.
    Magical items lose one charge per round; permanent magical items lose their magic after one hour in the sluk, but recover their power within 1d10 turns if removed before then. Relics and artifacts are not affected.
    Feesu and skullbirds enjoy an occasional nibble of sluk, but not enough to make a difference.

  Description: |
    Mimics are the result of a magical experiment. Despite their very thick, resilient hide, these creatures have the ability to change their shapes and colors at will in order to fool nearby victims, which they then feed on. Space mimics sometimes pass as ship debris floating in wildspace , as an ornate chest, or as an elaborate wizard's desk with books and scrolls in an abandoned ship.
    Space mimics have two eyes, which normally remain hidden under thick eyelids. In addition, space mimics can sense heat and light within 90 feet.
    Space mimics are about the same size as their planetside counterparts, about 150 cubic feet (a 3'Ã—6'Ã—8' chest for example or a small lifeboat). The natural skin of the space mimic is pitch black, with small specks of twinkling light, imitating a space background. The space mimic can change its shape and color in one round to resemble a piece of furniture made of any variety of wood, stone, or metal (either plain or carved). Like the common mimic, the space mimic must retain its normal size, but can otherwise radically alter its shape.
    The space mimic speaks its own tongue and often another three or four. The languages it is most likely to understand are neogi (01-20), the arcane tongue (21-40), huma common (41-70), beholder (71-75), elve (76-90), or illithid (91-95). On a roll of 96-00, the space mimic is eager to learn a new language.
  Combat: |
    Mimics use their shapechanging ability to surprise their victims (-4 penalty to the victim's surprise roll). If attacked, a space mimic lashes out with a pseudopod that inflicts 3d4 points of damage. The mimic is also covered with a strong glue that can hold anyone or anything coming in contact. A victim can be pulled free in three rounds only if the glue is weakened with a flask of alcohol. The space mimic can dissolve its glue anytime it so desires, and can control which areas of its hide are covered with the glue. Mimics are immune to acid, molds, green slime, and various puddings.
    Space mimics have the ability to cast the spells available to a 4th-level illusionist. This is an innate ability, and thus the spells do not require components. Space mimics do need to locate spell books or scrolls in order to acquire the spells initially. Once they have acquired a spell, they may use it as a 4th-level illusionist. Space mimics also need rest to recover spells previously cast. A common spell mix for space mimics might include the following: audible glamer , cantrip , spook , Nystul's magical aura , hypnotic pattern , improved phantasmal force , and invisibility.
    Space mimics are as much interested in food as they are in magic. When visitors approach, the space mimic stays invisible to study the party. If it finds out there is a wizard, the space mimic tries to lure the spellcaster somewhere alone, and then hypnotizes him while it steals books, scrolls, or magical items. After eating a victim, the mimic goes into hiding. If the party remains, the undiscovered mimic may attempt to lure yet another member when it hungers again.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Space mimics live in wildspace. They are solitary creatures that enjoy spending time reading space lore, tomes on magic, and other arcane volumes. Unlike their common cousins, space mimics have various cultures, usually based on their readings. These mimics are intelligent; they exchange books they already read for food or other books. Space mimics have neither religious beliefs nor any morals.
    When food is scarce, the mimic turns invisible and goes dormant for up to two to three years, after which time it will die unless it feeds. A good meal (one or two humans) sustains a space mimic for 1d4+4 months. Space mimics can levitate at will, which enables them to slowly travel across wildspace.
  Ecology: |
    Mimics were created by wizards to protect their treasures. This strain was created for long voyages, but they soon proved unreliable servants. After being discarded, mimics survived, reproducing by fission. Along with their glue, space mimics exude an odor that attracts rodents, space vermin, and occasional monsters as well.
    Body parts of the space mimic are as useful as that of its common cousin. In addition, the space mimic often keeps some treasure (usually books or scrolls) in a pocket under its belly.

  Description: |
    Every spelljamming ship needs a navigator; wildspace is big, and the chance for error is great. Space owls are intelligent owls with a gift for navigation. Humans , dwarves , and gnomes use them most often.
    Space owls resemble normal owls, with coloration ranging from dark brown to snowy white. They have big, yellow, unblinking eyes. The owls stand about 2Â½' tall, with a wingspan of 4'.
    These highly intelligent birds can communicate with all birds, both of groundling and wildspace origin. Space owls also speak Common and up to three other languages (DM's choice).
  Combat: |
    These cerebral birds are reluctant to enter combat. They would much rather discuss the conflict with their foe, trying to dig deep into the enemy's subconscious to explain their violent tendencies. Is it nature? Is it a bad upbringing? Since most foes resent being mentally dissected, this practice winds up infuriating an enemy even more.
    Thus, the space owls have no choice but to defend themselves, using their two sets of sharp talons to inflict 1d4 damage each. The space owls follow up with a beak blow, doing an additional 1d3 damage.
    Since space owls are brilliant, they realize that these attacks seldom deter an enemy. So they have developed the ability to cast invisibility , minor image , blink , ventriloquism , and spook , each three times a day, at 6th level. Also, owls can cast find the path , true seeing , and augury , each once per day.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Space owls congregate in small groups called parliaments. They nest in trees, on the roofs of buildings that house knowledge (observatories, sage houses, mage towers, libraries, laboratories), or in the wrecks of spelljammer ships. (When space owls lair in a spelljammer shipwreck, they often try to rebuild it.) An even number of owls in a parliament are mated pairs. For each pair, there is a 20% chance of 1d4 owlets, or a 10% chance of 1d4+1 eggs.
    Space owls live for 100+10d10 years. They are nocturnal, and so they love the starry night sky of wildspace. Bright lights, such as light spells, blind them. Space owls have exceptional hearing and ultravision, the latter only usable at night.
    All space owls have the Navigation proficiency, and they do not suffer the -2 check modifier. There is a 45% chance that trained space owls have 1d4 other proficiencies from the following list: Ancient History, Animal Lore, Astrology, Engineering, Reading Lips, Reading/Writing, and Spellcraft.
    The owls' sense of direction is 90% accurate. They can serve as a ship's navigator, and they need no star charts when travelling in their native sphere . The owls instinctively memorize the positions of all heavenly bodies in their native crystal sphere. They can learn the astronomical layouts of other crystal spheres, but this requires at least one month of travel in the sphere, followed by an Intelligence check. Studying an accurate map of the sphere, reduces study time to only 1d4 days, followed by the Intelligence check. In either case, success means that the owl now knows that sphere; failure means another month of travel or 1d4 days of map study.
    Besides navigation, space owls are adept at calculating planetary orbits, debating philosophy or science, and even playing chess. Their only drawback is an unfortunate tendency to ramble, over-analyze, and use huge polysyllabic words.
  Ecology: |
    Space owls need only a little air to breathe; a few minutes in an atmosphere every couple of days keeps them happy. They eat almost anything, including cooked food, wine, and sweets. In the wild, they eat plants, insects, and small rodents.
    Wizards who want a space owl familiar must still cast the find familiar spell, then persuade the owl to become a familiar.

  Description: |
    The space swine are a species of boar, custom-bred by the mercantile dohwar for a variety of uses. They serve primarily as trackers, since they have uncanny senses.
    Standing three feet at the shoulder and six feet long, the space swine also sport a pair of huge grey wings, resembling a pigeon's. The wings span about eight feet. A single blunt horn juts out six inches from the space swine's thick skull. The normal space swine coloration is a dirty or mottled brown. Space swine of remarkable lineage or belonging to influential dohwar may be pure white or black. Space swine grunt like pigs and sometimes coo like pigeons. Judging by the dohwar's irritation, some speculate that the pigs are not supposed to coo.
    Besides tracking, space swine also serve as beasts of burden, food, and (rarely) mounts. Though the dohwar are proud of their porcine creations, the other intelligent races consider the pigs an insane idea and nickname them "star pork".
  Combat: |
    Despite their odd appearance, space swine are fierce fighters, as ill-tempered as wild boars. The space swine's nasty bite does 2d4 damage.
    As a war mount, the space swine is trained to attack with its horn. If a space swine and his dohwar rider have at least 120' between themselves and their foe, the space swine can make a high-speed dive. During the dive, the space swine emits a piercing war-squeal that rises in pitch as it nears the target. Make an attack roll for the space swine to hit its target. If the space swine hits, its 500-pound weight does 2d10 crushing damage, and its horn impales for an additional 1d10 damage. After a hit, the space swine save vs. breath weapon or drop unconscious for 1d4 rounds with a light concussion. The riding dohwar, of course, is thrown.
    A space swine war mount can follow up to a dozen commands. These commands can be sign language or simple phrases. Though the space swine cannot speak, it recognizes its given name and its rider. If a space swine loses its rider in battle but has a chance to rescue the rider, the pig flies away fast (though it feels really bad about this and misses its rider terribly).
  Habitat/Society: |
    Space swine are raised in herds. A litter of space swine consists of 3d4 sucklings. Only the strong become war mounts. All space swine are rather good-natured, and do not pick fights, though adult space swine band together to defend sucklings from predators.
    Space swine are clean animals, preening their wings to keep them in good shape and airworthy. On hot planets , space swine enjoy rolling around in mud to cool off.
    Muscular animals, space swine can bear 400 pounds of weight with no encumbrance penalty. Despite their bulk, they are sure-footed. A space swine retains enough air for itself for 24 hours, or 18 hours with a rider.
    Space swine are uncanny trackers. If allowed to sniff a piece of a person's clothing, or a sample of some sort of material, the space swine can track the person or material in question with a Tracking proficiency level of 18. The material can be anything from gold to silver to water to truffles. Once on the scent, the space swine tracks relentlessly to the source; nothing stops it but fatigue, injury, or trickery.
    I wildspace , a space swine can find a scent up to 48,000 miles away. This distance drops by 2,000 miles for every hour of the scent's age. Thus, if a dohwar wished to track down a particular vessel that passed within 10,000 miles of the dohwar 12 hours ago, the space swine could pick up the scent. To determine success, use the space swine's Tracking proficiency level of 18.
    Space swine also taste delicious, roasted with applesauce on the side.
  Ecology: |
    Space swine can eat anything, and they manage to fulfill some small role in gobbling up space garbage tossed by passing ships. Other than this, the space swine have no real use except to the dohwar.
    The dohwar try to market space swine as an all-in-one animal for the knowledgeable explorer, but apparently those explorers have enough knowledge not to believe this. The only ones who purchase space swine in great numbers are the tinker gnomes , who think that space swine are "a brilliant idea".
    In desperation, the dohwar also try to sell space swine to spacegoing halflings , billing them as "dependable mounts, strong beasts of burden, and they make a tasty mid-afternoon snack". Thus far, the strategy has failed.

  Description: |
    Spacesea giants, or rover giants, are an offshoot of the groundling stone giant race that has found its way into arcane space. The ancestors of these giants were brought to space as neogi slaves, but they eventually managed to escape.
    Spacesea giants have hair, unlike their land-locked brethren. They exult in this, often growing their hair (and the males' beards) to resemble that of their god Ptah.
  Combat: |
    When battling from aboard their stone ships (see below), the giants prefer to engage in missile combat. Their ships' ballistae and their own rock-hurling abilities give them a potent missile attack. They can hurl their boulders with a range of 500 yards (1 hex), causing 3d10 points of damage or 1d3 points of hull damage per hit. All giant ships have a store of boulders for hurling and ship repair (see below).
    When engaged in melee, spacesea giants use either great stone clubs or maces (2d6+8) or strike with a fist for 1d10 points of damage or 1 point of hull damage per hit.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The first giants that escaped the neogi embraced the god Ptah, and they pleaded to him for aid. Ptah responded, granting them heightened intelligence, curiosity, and wisdom. In return for his aid, Ptah asked that the giants roam arcane space, to learn of its immensity and to appreciate its creator, their benefactor. The giants agreed, and they now rove far and wide throughout the spheres , learning and worshiping. As their intelligence has increased, so has their appreciation of art, as seen on the hulls and sails of their ships.
    Almost all spacesea giants worship Ptah and devote their lives to the exploration of arcane space, with particular attention to wildspace . Many giants capitalize on this drive by hiring out as explorers, escorts, or scouts for other, non-evil races. Some giants make their living as merchants. Their large, sturdy ships excel in this capacity. Also, most pirates hesitate (to say the least) to attack a giant ship.
    Giants can use, at least temporarily, any ship that can be modified to accept their bulk, but they prefer to use ships of their own construction . These resemble huge groundling galleons , made of solid stone.
    These ships are larger than a normal galleon to allow for the giants' greater size. Like their groundling ancestors, spacesea giants feel more comfortable with a large mass of stone surrounding them. With the above exceptions, spacesea galleons are not much different from others of their type.
    Along with their intelligence increase, the frequency of elders and magic-using giants has gone up. For every ten giants, one is an elder who is able to use stone shape , stone tell , and transmute rock to mud spells, once per day, as a 7th-level mage. Of these elders, 50% can cast wizard or priest spells as 5th-level spellcasters. It is these elders who man the helm; the oldest is most often the ship's captain. They can also use their magical abilities, and the ever-present boulders, to repair hull damage to their ships. Each boulder yields enough material to repair 1d4 points of hull or mast (but not rigging) damage. None of these magical powers are usable in the phlogisto.
  Ecology: |
    The main weakness of the spacesea giants is their need for air, and this is the reason the giants seldom venture into the phlogiston. To this end, most giant ships carry a garden of green plants to help replenish the air supply. These plants also serve as food for the giants and the 1d4 giant goats each ship carries for dairy products (the goats also serve as convenient garbage disposals).

  Description: |
    The spirit warrior is an enormous undead insect, the primary long-range weapon of elve crack troops during the Unhuman Wars . All Spirit Warriors went into time storage after the end of the Unhuman Wars, and they occasionally emerge in modern times.
    A fighter operates the spirit warrior from a cavity inside the chest. This is the spirit warrior's master (also called a spirit warrior, as the two become essentially one).
    Spirit warriors are of three types: carnivores, herbivores, and nektars. Carnivores descend from the praying mantis. They have its slashing, grasping forelimbs and biting mandibles. Their wings bear eye-spots that they reflexively display before combat.
    Herbivores are based on the katydid. Though they are thin and spindly in build, their powerful legs carry them 600' forward or backward, and up to 400' vertically. Their wings and limbs are leaf-shaped.
    Nektars defend from an insect similar to both a butterfly and a wasp. Nektar spirit warriors are brightly colored, with iridescent thoraxes and alternating bands of color on their abdomens. Their wings are large and colorful, with various patterns.
    All breeds of spirit warrior have at least two clawed hands, feet that adhere to any surface, and functional wings that enable them to make gliding leaps of 100-600' on planets . They also wield various melee weapons scaled to their size.
  Combat: |
    A spirit warrior's number of attacks depends on its master's ability â€“ for instance, a 1st-level fighter attacks once per round, so his spirit warrior can only attack once per round. Conversely, a 12th-level fighter's spirit warrior can attack three times every two rounds. Most spirit warriors attack with a giant longsword, doing triple normal damage (3d8). Some warriors use special bows with a range of 500 yards. The arrows do triple normal damage (3d6); there is a 5% chance that one arrow is an arrow of slaying . All spirit warriors can deliver two claw attacks for 3d6 per claw, in lieu of the weapon strike.
    The various species also have different attacks as follows: Carnivores bite for 5d6 damage. The forelimbs of the carnivore spirit warrior can grapple an opponent on a successful attack roll, inflicting 1d6 crushing damage each round thereafter. A successful grapple immobilizes a smaller opponent, and later attacks hit automatically. A grappled opponent gets a Strength ability check each round to break free.
    Herbivores can change color like a chameleon, becoming almost invisible to an opponent (surprise on 1-4 on 1d6). Their screech attack does 2d10 sonic damage per round. The herbivore uses its leaping ability to jump over its opponent, somersaulting in midair to land and strike from behind (+2 to hit when the master makes a successful Dexterity check).
    Nektars have a smooth wasp-like stinger. In life, a gland pumps a poison through the stinger, inflicting a painful wound. The spirit warrior has a hollow stinger outfitted with a small greek fire projector with 1d3 shots. The stinger can fire every other round for 3d6 damage at a range of 50 yards.
    The spirit warrior body "remembers" its previous existence as a living insect and confers its sense of absolute balance to the master, making disorientation impossible.
    The bonding between the spirit warrior and its master means that damage to the spirit warrior is relayed to the master. In the event of a critical hit, the master must save vs. death. Failure means both spirit warrior and master die from shock.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Spirit warriors are weapons from the Unhuman Wars. There are three ways to acquire one: find one that has been abandoned, wrest one from its owner in combat, or grow one from an egg and perform the appropriate spells. Since the Wars ranged over a great area, the chance of finding an abandoned warrior is small. Also, those still piloted have most likely been around since the time of the Wars, so wresting one from its master in combat is also unlikely. This leaves the method of growing one from an egg, as follows:
    The would-be spirit warrior receives an egg. The fighter must incubate the pinhead-sized egg in a warm and secure environment, preferably next to the fighter's body. When the egg hatches, the warrior must nurture and protect the fragile larva from six months to a year, until it is mature. This nurturing involves close emotional contact with the insect (stroking, petting, cuddling, thinking pleasant thoughts) to develop a strong emotional bond as one would with a pet or familiar. After a year the insect is mature, and the spells of modification begin; however, for the strongest bond, this final process is delayed until after the insect has died of old age. If the spells are performed on a living insect, it dies during the ceremony.
    The insect becomes a spirit warrior via spells that enlarge, animate, strengthen, and physically modify the insect's remains. These spells also link the minds of warrior and insect in an unbreakable bond, unaffected by magic, disease, physical attack, or mental control. The final stage of the process installs a special minor helm in the hollow chest cavity of the insect warrior.
    There is a base 5% chance that the discoverer of an abandoned warrior can forge a new bond with it. Alignment affects this chance, for warriors created for the Unhuman Wars were of either good or neutral alignment (law and chaos were of no consequence). If the discoverer's alignment differs from the warrior's, the bonding chance decreases 1% for each degree of difference â€“ for example, if the spirit warrior is good in alignment and the finder is neutral, the chance of bonding drops to 4%; if the finder is evil, the chance drops to 3%.
    If the 5% chance fails, the effects on the discoverer who attempted the bond range from devastating to deadly. Roll percentile dice and consult this table.
    Die Roll Effect
    01-25    Unconscious for 1d3 days.
    26-85    Stroke (cerebral hemorrhage); victim incapacitated. DM's choice of specific effects: loss of motor skills, speech impairment, etc.
    86-00    Death due to massive stroke and psychic trauma.
    The reason for such severe results is the bonding process itself. The process effects physical changes on the would-be spirit warrior's brain and nervous system. When the bonding takes place between an insect and its keeper, the links are easily forged due to the years of intimate contact. For a stranger to attempt such a bonding is dangerous indeed.
  Ecology: |
    This is only important when the spirit warrior larva is being nurtured. Nektars and herbivores feed on one or two specific types of flowering plants. Growing these flowers requires a hothouse. An insect can eat up to 30 times its body weight in a day.
    Carnivores also develop preferences and are more insistent. The master may grow anxious when the insect is hungry, resulting in mood swings and irrational behavior (for instance, drastic reductions in the local space hamster population) in both master and insect.
    During the Unhuman Wars, elvish mages created the warriors as armored, super-strong weapons to counter orcish monsters being released on various worlds. At first their years of research only worked up to a point: the giant undead insects ran amok, killing researchers and damaging Armada Noble itself.
    An assistant, Rowan Starblade by name, discovered that the ceremonies failed because the researchers and the insects shared no emotional bond. When one of Rowan's "pet" research insects rampaged after the ill-fated ceremony, she threw herself in front of the beast, begging it to stop. To her surprise, the giant insect obeyed her command!
    Further experimentation with Rowan's pet zombie revealed that when she welded a modified minor helm in the insect's hollow chest cavity with gold and platinum wire, she could sit in the helm and pilot the insect with her speed and agility, and with the insect's strength.
  Zwarth: |
    This large version of the spirit warrior, piloted by crews of 5-8 people, has as many attacks per round as it has crew members. It is capable of true spelljamming flight and can use many weapons. The zwarth has the magical power of spell projectio . A spellcaster in a zwarth can amplify attack spells, doing a spell's dice of damage in hull points. For instance, if an ordinary magic missile does 1d4+1 points of damage, then the same magic missile , cast through the zwarth's hands, would do 1d4+1 hull points of damage!
    Zwarth construction resembles that of a spirit warrior. Growth and bonding process are the same. (Yes, an entire party must undergo this process!)

  Description: |
    A spiritjam is the soul of an evil cleric or wizard who died while spelljamming . The spirit of the cleric or wizard remained behind when the physical body perished. The spiritjam in life could have been a drow , half-elf , or huma . It moves easily through space.
    A spiritjam appears as a floating, diaphanous form resembling its former human or demihuman body. A spiritjam can be easily differentiated from other undead because of its eyes, which sparkle like stars, and its hands, which have abnormally long fingers ending in claws. The hair of a spiritjam appears as a cloud-like mist that surrounds the undead creature's head.
  Combat: |
    Spiritjams envy and hate all life, especially spacefarers. They pass through the walls of ships to attack those inside. Their primary targets are a ship's spelljamming wizard or cleric and the ship's captain. By disabling these people, spiritjams hope to cripple the ship and then feed on the rest at their leisure.
    A spiritjam prefers to move through a ship's walls, remaining hidden and observing the crew until it has selected its first targets. Then it comes up behind its target and attacks with its claws. Each claw hit drains 1d3 points of Intelligence from the victim. When a victim's Intelligence reaches 0, he dies. Lost Intelligence is regained at a rate of 2 points per day.
    Spiritjams prefer to attack physically because of their Intelligence-draining ability. However, when they are threatened or outnumbered, they attack with spells to put the odds in their favor. Spiritjams retain the spellcasting ability they had in life. The spiritjam has access to the spells its original form had memorized on the day of its death; the spiritjam cannot memorize additional spells. Spiritjams were usually spellcasters of 7th level or higher. To randomly determine the spellcasting level, roll 1d6 and add 6.
    Spiritjams also possess a gaze weapon. Creatures meeting the gaze of a spiritjam must roll successful saving throws vs. petrification or stand paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Spiritjams are immune to petrification and fear spells.
    Blunt weapons, even magical ones, cannot harm spiritjams. Only magical edged weapons can deal them any damage. Further, their magic resistance makes them terrible foes. They are turned as special undead. If a dispel evil spell breaches their magic resistance, a spiritjam is driven away for 1d12 hours.
    Spiritjams can sense life within a 500-mile radius of themselves, and they can sense someone spelljamming within a 5,000-mile radius. They can attack in space at anytime, as a spiritjam is undead and therefore never rests. However, if a spiritjam travels to a planet , its activity cycle is restricted to the evening. It is further hampered because it can only attack when stars are visible outside. For this reason, most spiritjams restrict their travels to space.
    A few spiritjams seek out enemies their former selves faced in life.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Spiritjams hate all life because they detest their own undead state. They make their homes on moons or barren planets near populated worlds. The spiritjams observe these worlds and the comings and goings of ships. When they have gathered enough information, they begin their attacks on the shipping lanes.
    The land around the lair of a spiritjam is littered with bits of ships and the personal possessions of its victims. Once a lair is established, the spiritjam is loathe to leave it. Only driving the spiritjam away or eliminating ship travel to nearby worlds can cause it to seek another home.
    Spiritjams are exceptionally intelligent and understand many languages. Many of them appreciate the finer things in life, collecting art objects and valuables from their victims.
    Frequently a spiritjam's lair will have from one to three spelljamming helms . Usually these helms are damaged. The lairs sometimes resemble trophy rooms, containing objects from the ships the spiritjam attacked.

    The only pleasure spiritjams have is in killing. They are like a disease, killing without reason or discretion. As they are undead, they do not eat or gain sustenance. They have no natural predators.

  Description: |
    Star selkies, though large and carnivorous, are actually an ethereal, shape-changing humanoid race. In their huma form, they are kind, gentle individuals of remarkable beauty. Like terrestrial selkies, they have striking green, blue, or black eyes, with irises that sparkle with an inner light. Though somewhat absentminded, they are highly intelligent and well-versed in the lore of wildspace.
    Selkies may retain their human form for up to two weeks at a time. In human form, the selkie communicates in both its own language and Common. In flight, selkies understand spoken language, but communicate among themselves in an unspoken tongue that is as yet unknown.
    It is said that star selkies originated from a group of Ptah worshippers whose colony barge crashed on a barren asteroid . In answer to their prayers of salvation, Ptah turned them into the graceful, space-adapted selkies. However, there is only circumstantial evidence of this legend.
  Combat: |
    In flight, star selkies are savage, deadly fighters. Their armored, bullet-shaped bodies have razor-sharp guide fins and a prow sheathed in natural armor (AC 2). This armored prow does 1d2 hull points of damage. As high-speed battering rams, they impale their prey. The selkie then extrudes ten tentacles that automatically hit impaled victims. These tentacles, tipped with lamprey-like mouths, attach to the victims and drain 1 hit point per round. A successful Bend Bars/Lift Gates roll destroys one tentacle. A victim can roll to destroy a tentacle once per round.
    Star selkies use an inborn ability similar to a fly spell to move in any direction, as slowly as a walking human (MV 12) or as fast as a seasoned spelljammer ( SR 5).
  Habitat/Society: |
    Star selkie communities resemble their terrestrial counterparts. Both sexes hunt and gather food and share responsibilities for child-rearing. If anything, star selkies are more gregarious than their sea-going kin, occasionally even settling larger human habitations in selkie enclaves. The selkie predilection for scavenging space wrecks has proven to be very useful to them. A number of selkie merchants deal in "reclaimed goods".
    Though primarily carnivorous, selkies consider eating humanoid flesh an act of cannibalism. They prefer to eat the wildlife of wildspace, and do not normally attack spelljamming ships (except in self defense). On the contrary, star selkies sometimes help lost travelers, leading them to safe, well-charted areas.
    The selkie leaders can cast the following spells once per day: create air , charm monster , cure critical wounds , and sunray . They also have an ability similar to a modified stone shape spell that allows them to construct their enclaves. The leader casts these spells as a 8th-level wizard.
  Ecology: |
    Though the star selkie is a carnivore, it is sensitive to over-hunting of its habitat. Trade with ground dwellers supplements its diet. The star selkie population has increased slightly, but their birthrate is still low.
    Star selkies have a special gland that produces oxygen, allowing them to travel in space as long as there is food to eat. This gland does not function properly until the selkie's third year of life, so selkie habitats (called "enclaves") must be air-filled.
    Star selkies occasionally attract and take human mates. Offspring of such a pairing breed true as selkies. Such mixed colonies are easy to spot, for the enclaves sport intricate freeform surface dwellings to accommodate the human mates. These surface dwellings tend to be large Egyptian-style structures, lending further credence to the theory of Ptah-worshipping ancestry.

  Description: |
    This colorful butterfly-shaped plant drifts slowly through wildspace , much to the delight of spelljammer crews â€“ its fruit is delicious! Spelljammers consider the starfly plant an omen of good luck, since it not only ends hunger but also symbolizes wealth and happiness.
    The gossamer wings of the starfly trap sunlight, converting it to sugary food for the seed nestled inside. Similar to a peach pit, the warty, almond-shaped seed contains foul-tasting chemicals poisonous to living things.
  Ecology: |
    The starfly is actually the mobile fruit of a spacefaring plant, a tree that grows to maturity rooted in the ice and dirt of comets. Known as a mother-tree, it grows winged fruits that drift across space in search of new comets to seed.
    The starfly's shape resembles elve spacecraft, leading scholars to suppose (correctly) that elves took these plants and enchanted them to grow to maturity while mobile, thus creating variants such as the gadabout and the elven armada ship. In truth, the starfly is the mainstay of spacegoing elvenkind, since its simple form is so easily changed.
    Mother-tree: This plant is the mature form of the starfly. Once the fruit has landed on a comet, the seed takes root and begins to digest the cometary ice and minerals. The sapling grows winglike leaves that take in sunlight. After a time, the young tree develops a bulb that stores water. At this stage, the leaves become reflective, focusing sunlight on the bulb and heating the water within. The resulting steam jets out of the bulb nozzles, pushing comet and plant closer to the su . Once the tree is close enough, the leaves fall away, and the second stage of life begins.
    In this phase, the tree feeds on the remaining minerals of the comet. By the time they are gone, the tree is large enough to generate a gravity plane and hold an air envelope. As the tree grows, its gravity plane attracts rocks and debris into the tree's organic furnace, further aiding the tree's growth. When the tree has grown to about 1000 feet, the smelting pods wither, giving off gases that create air.
    New growth begins, dense clusters of leaves that form a habitat for animals and other plants. When the tree matures, it is a fully functioning ecology. The tree's gravity may pull in other rock bodies, supporting further growth and eventually creating a liveworld.
    It is rumored that elven wizards have used secret spells to mount special helms into mother-trees for use as spelljammers. The rumor says that the giant trees will succeed the armadas as the mainstays of the elven space fleet. As yet the rumor remains unproven, but rivals of the elves would pay a great deal to anyone who can confirm it.

  Description: |
    The stargazer is a large, four-legged reptilian asteroid-dweller. Its rocky skin mimics crystalline outcroppings, giving it an AC of -2.
    The stargazer is often mistaken for a large lump of precious stone amid a larger stone formation or on the ground. The stony, gemlike carapace hides a frog-like mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth, as well as four sharp claws which are kept folded under the stargazer's body.
    The hide absorbs sunlight, both to warm the beast's body and to power the beast's main weapon, lightning discharges. Hides show a variety of colors and crystalline formations, but generally they are reddish or violet, suggesting deposits of ruby or amethyst. Citrine, emerald and sapphire varieties are also seen.
  Combat: |
    The stargazer uses its carapace as a blind, imitating an outcropping of precious stone. Wandering animals or greedy adventurers entranced with their find receive a "shocking" surprise.
    When the stargazer senses prey (25' range), twin lightning bolts leap from its eyes, doing 6d6 electrical damage per bolt; the bolts can fire independently at different targets. It then raises itself from its shallow hiding space and lunges toward the victim, biting (4d6) and rending with claws (1d8). It can loose up to six lightning bolts, two per round, before stopping to recharge.
    If the stargazer is losing a battle, it rolls itself into a ball, stone shell outward, protecting its soft underside (AC 8). It rolls in a random direction to escape its tormentor. Roll a 1d12 to determine the direction the beast escapes in; numbers on the die correspond to positions on a clock face. Those in the indicated direction must save vs. breath weapon. Those who fail the saving throw are run over. Victims caught by this rolling action suffer 4d6 crushing damage.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Stargazers live on the sunny sides of large asteroids , basking in the continual sunlight. They are solitary, mating quickly, hiding their eggs, and abandoning them. Stargazers are territorial, guarding a range of 1-3 square miles. Two stargazers may occupy opposite hemispheres of a single asteroid, establishing the opposite sides of the gravity plane as their "territory".
    In mating season stargazers may duel to the death over territory, mates, and prey. If an area is overpopulated, the stargazer uses its powerful hind legs to leap from the asteroid. It then rolls into a ball, to drift through space in hibernation until caught by the gravity of another asteroid or a shipload of greedy spelljammers. The advent of spelljamming humanoids has enlarged their range.
  Ecology: |
    The stargazer is a voracious killer, prone to berserker rages against large opponents. The monster is its own treasure; specifically, the carapace is actually an organic form of the crystal that it most resembles. There is one drawback: Unless treated with a permanency spell, the carapace crumbles to dust 1d6 days after the stargazer's death. Jewelers can cut magically treated stargazer shells to produce 1d6 gems of (4d6+1)Ã—1000 gp each.

  Description: |
    Big, peaceful, and highly intelligent, these enormous philosophers of the phlogisto wander the flow seeking discourse with the keepers of the crystal spheres.
    The scales of stellar dragons are iridescent deep purple, with a chrome drop at the tip of each scale. Gems of myriad colors and sizes adorn the scales in random patterns, giving the stellar dragon its name. Two main fins, like the fins of a lionfish, adorn either side of the central torso, and four enormous lace-like wings provide guidance and stability. Numerous other fins of various sizes cover the rest of the drago 's body. They have no visible arms or legs.
    Stellar dragons, unlike their smaller kin, the radiants , are neutral. They consider stooping to meddle in the affairs of smaller beings to be loutish and in bad taste. When they encounter humanoids, stellar dragons prefer to watch rather than involve themselves. Only rarely do they speak with lesser beings.
    However, if one has information previously unknown to the dragon, this may gain its interest and even useful knowledge in trade. Information is the stellar dragon's food and drink, if anything is, and it is willing to trade in kind. (One rumor has it that the Greyhawk wizard Bigby learned his interposing hand and grasping hand spells from a stellar dragon in exchange for a juicy tidbit of information.)
    Stellar dragons literally consume their knowledge, transforming it into clear or milky gems of varying size. These gems of wisdom and pearls of knowledge push their way outward to rest embedded in the dragon's scales. The number of gems and pearls studding its scales mark its status among other dragons. The encrustation also roughly indicates its age; younger dragons have few gems, whereas venerable stellars are literally covered in jewels. The chief, or mikado, is another case entirely (see below).
  Combat: |
    Though not normally aggressive, the stellar dragon can easily defend itself. Its unique "breath weapon" is gravitic: rather than emitting breath, it draws things into the dragon's internally generated sphere of annihilation . The mouth, a focus for the sphere, confines its gravitic attraction to a cone 1,200 yards long, 50' wide at the dragon's mouth and 600' wide at the base. A successful save vs. breath weapon negates the effect.
    The stellar dragon has three other innate attacks. First, it can randomly teleport an attacker 500-6000 yards (1d12 hexes) in any direction.
    Second, its titanic intellect lets it use any wizard's spell in the Player's Handbook without error. It can also modify or create spells to suit its needs; for example, it could merge darkness, 50' radius and fireball to create a shadow flare spell. It can repeat spells as often as needed.
    Third, it ca summo one denizen of another plane once per round for up to seven rounds (DM's choice of any monster up to half the dragon's own HD in strength). Summoned individuals serve the dragon slavishly, remaining for 2d6 rounds before they "snap" back to their home continuum.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The stellar dragons' range covers the entire cosmos, so their exact numbers are unknown; parties encounter them only rarely. However, once every 500 years, the stellar dragons convene for their mating ceremony. In this ceremony, the most worthy stellar dragons are selected by their tribal head, called the mikado. There is only one mikado at any time. The mikado is distinguished by the single crystal horn on his forehead.
    Those dragons that the mikado selects as mates each produce a single offspring. This dragon, born fully sentient, leaves to make its own way among the stars.
    Stellar dragon territories are vast, extending into other planes and dimensions. Individuals negotiate boundaries to prevent intrusion on each other's space. However, they haggle endlessly to obtain dynamic civilizations to monitor.
    The dragons deal with attackers handily. However, if a party approaches the dragon with respect and choice information, chances are even that the dragon deigns to talk. Chances are equally good that the dragon is thinking (that is, digesting) and dismisses the interlopers.
    The stellar dragon's ultimate goal is truth. It abhors dishonesty and misinformation. Though its information may be cryptic, it is never false. A lesser being's misinterpretation is that being's own fault. Misinformation causes a stellar dragon severe, painful indigestion. And as with its smaller kin, a dragon in pain is dangerous.
  Ecology: |
    The stellar dragon understands the underpinnings of the multiverse. These primeval watchers have seen the rise and fall of many civilizations. Such is the power of this knowledge that according to some texts, the power of artifacts and relics comes from the gems that encrust them. The crystallized everlasting knowledge of thousands of beings, say these legends, provides the power that runs these wonderful objects. How these gems were wrested from the stellar dragons remains unsaid.
    Gems of wisdom and pearls of knowledge are valuable almost beyond calculation. The information they contain can be liberated and used to gain enormous profit. Sages and wizards do nearly anything to gain one.

  Description: |
    Stellar undead are the corpses of spelljamming sailors returned to a semblance of life. The corpses are animated by raw energy from the Negative Material Plane. This energy warps the dying sailors' brains, twisting their final thoughts of home, safety, and friends into an unholy desire to walk again among the living, and to be warm again by drinking their blood.
    Due to the vacuum of wildspace , most bodies decompose very slowly. When viewed from more than 3' away, stellar undead do not look dead, but much as they did in life. Though their bodies and clothes show the cause of their deaths, they remove weapons stuck in their bodies.
    Stellar undead retain some vestiges of intelligence, and can speak one language of those they knew in life. Their voices are a hollow croak, though some confuse this with a thirsty sailor's dry throat. Most of their words are monosyllables such as "help", "yes", "no", "food", or "thanks".
    In order to track down warm-blooded bodies, the stellar undead have infravision with 90' range.
  Combat: |
    Stellar undead attack by clawing their opponents (2d4 damage per hand) and biting them (3d4 damage). If both claw attacks hit one victim in the same round, the bite attack on the same victim, if successful, does double damage.
    Once a victim has been hit by all three attacks in one round, the undead changes its tactics. Instead of attacking with its claws, it holds tight to its new meal, automatically doing 2 hp damage on each later round. The undead continues biting, doing double damage if it hits. The victim can break away by making a successful Strength check (allowed once per round).
    Like most undead , the stellar undead are immune to all mind-affecting spells such as sleep , charm , fear , and hold spells. Due to their close relationship with the Negative Plane, they are turned as liches. A direct hit with holy water causes 2d12 damage; a splash does 1d6 damage.
    Though the stellar undead still have the clothes and weapons that they wore in life, they have forgotten how to use them. Some clumsily try to swing a sword or activate a wand, without success.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Stellar undead have no society or leader. They tend to congregate around areas where it is normal to find bedraggled survivors, such as spelljammer wrecks. Sometimes they are found on barren asteroids , where they appear as castaways of a ship crash.
    Their common trick is to cling to fragments of a spelljamming ship and pretend to be stranded sailors. Some act unconscious, while others wave frantically and call out to passing ships. When brought aboard, they try to pass for living sailors as long as possible, though there is a cumulative 5% chance per turn that the undead lose their self-control and attack in force, sinking their teeth into the first warm flesh they can grab.
    Besides attempting normal "living person combat", stellar undead sometimes (45%) try non-violent actions from life (eating food, drinking, writing) to keep up the sham of life before their hosts. Otherwise, the undead just go where they are led, mumbling thanks until they cannot take it anymore and tear into their rescuers.
    The chance of stellar undead successfully imitating the living depends on how long ago the corpses died. At the beginning of the encounters roll percentile dice. The result is both how many days prior to the encounter that the ship crew died, and the chance that any attempt to "act normal" fails. Thus, a roll of 47 means that the stellar undead died and were "created" 47 days before being found. Once aboard, one stellar undead tries to act normal by drinking from a flask; in this example, there is a 47% chance that the attempt to drink fails.
  Ecology: |
    Stellar undead exist only in the Prime Material Plane. If encountered within five miles of an actual gate to the Negative Material Plane, the stellar undead cannot be turned, and they regenerate 2 hp per round.
    The stellar undead can sense the presence of other types of undead in their line of sight.

  Description: |
    The benevolent sun dragons live and cavort on the surface of suns . Though majestic and intelligent, they love life and freedom, showing this love in a playful attitude.
    The sun dragon's coloration changes as it ages, matching stellar evolution. At hatching, they are fiery red; as juveniles , burnt orange; as mature adults , brilliant yellow; when venerable , bluish white. Finally, when a sun dragon becomes a Great Wyrm , it shrinks back to almost hatchling size and turns a flat white color.
    Some people confuse these sun dragons for very young moon dragons , at much risk to their health.
    Sun dragons speak their own language, as well as the language of all good dragons and Common. Though a happy race, they hate moon dragons, their mortal enemies.
  Combat: |
    Sun dragons have little interest in combat. Since they lair on the hot surfaces of suns, few opponents get close enough to invade their homes. When necessary, the sun dragon uses its breath weapon to soften up opponents (3d8 damage), then pauses so that enemies can reconsider and retreat. If the enemy does not, the dragon breathes again and charges, teeth and claws flashing (1d10 each).
    Sometimes it acts like a big cat, picking up its enemies, batting them around, and swatting them into the air. In this case, the victims avoid claw damage but take 1d10 damage from the buffeting. Victims lose initiative and must make an ability check against half their Dexterity to take action in the following round.
  Breath Weapon/Special Abilities: |
    Sun dragons "spit" fireballs with a range of 240' and an explosion radius of 5' per age category of the sun dragon. The dragon can also coat the fiery wad with its special saliva, delaying the blast for up to ten rounds. The dragon can control the detonation time exactly.
    Certain innate spell abilities manifest themselves at different ages. A dragon can use each spell ability three times a day. Juvenile dragons gain heat metal ; adults , fire shield ; and very old dragons, prismatic spray . Whenever a sun dragon takes flight, its entire body is suffused by continual light . Sun dragons are immune to all forms of fire; they save at -2 vs. cold-based attacks. Finally, a sun dragon can innately sense the presence of a moon dragon in its crystal sphere.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Sun dragons scoop out the fiery matter on a sun's surface and hollow out good-sized caverns for their needs. When a sun dragon lays its clutch of 1d4+1 fire-resistant eggs, it causes a solar flare to erupt on the sun's surface.
    When a sun dragon dies of old age, the body collapses in on itself, creating a sphere of annihilation (95% probability) or a well of many worlds (5%). These creations are unstable, with a 1% per day (cumulative) chance to dissipate unless a permanency spell is cast upon them.
    Sun dragon treasure is coated with the beast's saliva to keep it from melting into nothingness. When the items are removed from the heat of the sun, the saliva freezes into a kind of sleet that can be easily removed.
  Ecology: |
    Sun dragons eat anything, but they are careful not to eat intelligent creatures, for they respect life.

  Description: |
    Survivors are high-level, intelligent humans , demihumans, or humanoids who have been trapped in a state of suspended animation and drifting in the phlogisto for many years â€“ often centuries, sometimes even longer. Such extreme exposure to the exotic vapors of the phlogiston works changes in the minds of the survivors, making them both more, and less, human.
    When found, a survivor is in the unusual state of suspended animation induced by the phlogiston. Its skin is gray and stony. Its clothes are at least several decades, if not centuries, out of fashion. Aside from this, it looks just like any other person would after drifting in the phlogiston for any period of time. The only remarkable thing about it is that the survivor does not awaken from its phlogiston-induced coma for more than a few minutes or hours at a time. Its flesh returns to normal within hours after exposure to air. When conscious, it accepts food and drink (soup, water, ale, etc.), but it is extremely weak and unable to stand or speak above a whisper.
  Combat: |
    A survivor does not engage in normal melee or magical combat. Instead, it gradually takes over the minds of crew members aboard the spelljamming vessel that had the misfortune to rescue it. It takes over one crew member every day (24 hours), starting with the weakest or least intelligent and working its way up to more powerful and more useful slaves. Humans, demihumans, and humanoids are all targets. The character who is being attacked this way is allowed a saving throw vs. spells, but because the process is so gradual (stretching over the full 24-hour period), there is a -2 penalty to the die roll. A character who rolls an unmodified 20 saves automatically and also becomes vaguely aware that something is amiss. Other characters who save successfully without rolling a 20 may complain of headaches, but they blame these on foul air or bad food.
    Once a character is controlled, the survivor can make full use of that character's senses. It can see, hear, taste, smell, and feel anything the character can. As it acquires more slaves, it can make use of any or all of their sensory input.
    At first, controlled characters don't act any differently than before. Gradually (within a week), they become sullen and withdrawn, going about their work with no humor or enthusiasm. The more slaves the survivor has, the more sullen and withdrawn they all become.
    Eventually, the survivor tries to seize control of the ship. If it controls everyone aboard, this is quite easy. If it becomes aware that someone aboard is getting suspicious and it feels that its chances are good, or it senses that it may be attacked, it stages a mutiny, using whatever slaves it has to take the ship by force. Its slaves still have the full use of all their powers and abilities, and the survivor uses these as intelligently as possible during a mutiny. (If, for example, the survivor controls the ship's captain and crew, but it believes that a group of PC passengers is getting suspicious, it may simply have the captain try to calm their fears and explain that this sort of sullen behavior is common toward the end of a long voyage, thereby buying more time in which to try enslaving the PCs.)
    The effect of the survivor's enslavement can be removed by the 5th-level priest spell dispel evil , the 3rd-level wizard spell dispel magic (the survivor is considered a 10th-level wizard for purposes of dispelling its control), or a wish or limited wish . Once released from the survivor's control, a former slave knows that he feels better, but doesn't know why.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The survivor has no social structure. It is almost always entirely solitary. More than one may be encountered if the DM wants to challenge an especially powerful group of PCs, but this should be reserved for extreme cases. (They may have been a pair of criminals who were lashed together and thrown overboard, for example, explaining how they managed to stay together through the years.)
    Once the survivor takes control of a ship, its only goal is to acquire more slaves. The survivor can control a number of slaves equal to 10 times its Intelligence score. If it reaches a port, it may have its slaves move it ashore, where it could conceivably enslave an entire small town. Or, it may continue operating the spelljammer, taking on unsuspecting passengers at every port.
  Ecology: |
    The survivor's only desire is sensory input, which it has been starved of for so long, and it will do anything to get it.

  Description: |
    The syllix is a highly developed invertebrate, resembling a cross between a worm and a salamander. The syllix's body is segmented, tapering to a pointed tail and a worm-like head with a pair of wide, unblinking eyes. It has a long, forked tongue that is often slipping in and out of its mouth.
    Unlike a worm, however, the syllix also has a two pairs of limbs. These are rubbery, tentacle-like appendages. Each of the lower limbs ends in a flat pad. The upper limbs end in six smaller tentacles that, because of their boneless nature, are even more dextrous than fingers.
    A syllix can move by crawling or slithering along the ground, or by walking upright on its two rear limbs. In the latter mode its movement is reduced to half that listed above. When crawling, however, the syllix cannot use a weapon.
    Syllix speak their own tongue. Some of them have learned the common language, but their speech is very sibilant, unpleasant for most other creatures to listen to. Also, their war-like nature is well known, so these creatures do not engage in a lot of pleasant chit-chat with creatures of other races.
  Combat: |
    Syllix use a variety of weapons well. They are particularly fond of specially modified light crossbows and short swords. Syllix attack aggressively and make good use of terrain, ship features, or anything else that might provide a tactical advantage.
    In normal times, the syllix fight tenaciously, with a morale of 13. However, during the outbreaks of the Eruption (see "Habitat/Society"), the morale of a band of syllix improves to 15.
    Syllix are eager to capture prisoners when they engage in battle with other races. Often they stage a boarding raid to acquire prisoners, then retire to their own vessel and leave.
    The fate of the prisoners is not known to creatures of other races, though it is rumored to be horrible beyond belief. The common belief is that syllix require enzymes from the living brains of intelligent creatures in order to breed the mage-stars (see "Habitat/Society") that they need for space travel. Prisoners are kept immobilized, but conscious and alive, for months, often in excruciating pain. During this time, their brains are literally sucked out of their skulls by a developing mage-star.
    In space, the syllix employ vessels with spelljamming helms powered by the mage-stars. They have been encountered on several types of vessels, including squid ships , hammerships , and galleons.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The syllix develop in a very small area, such as an asteroid or an island on a planet . They breed and feed until the population of their land, fleet, or asteroid reaches explosive proportions. Hermaphroditic, each syllix gives birth after it has eaten enough food. Eventually, the syllix start to give birth to a generation of blind, white young. These are called the mage-stars.
    The mage-stars are syllix in every way, except that they are blind â€“ and thus do not study nor practice combat â€“ and they have the innate ability to activate a spelljammer helm. When these mage-stars reach maturity (after about three years), the syllix suddenly go through the great convulsion their society, and the rest of the worlds, call the Eruption.
    An erupting band of syllix has one mage-starred helm of SR 6, two of SR 5, three of SR 4, and so on through six of SR 1.
    Guided by their mage-stars, the syllix break out of their homeworld and spread across space in an orgy of attacking, looting, and killing. No prisoners are taken when the syllix are in the midst of an Eruption. Each individual attacks with a +1 bonus to all attack rolls. Their morale is increased to the champion level.
  Ecology: |
    The syllix is a meat-eating scavenger. It can live in most climates, but it prefers those that serve as habitat for a lot of potential food. Many an island, asteroid, or small continent has been ravaged by a growing host of syllix during their breeding stage.

  Description: |
    Tinker gnomes are constantly designing, building, and testing devices for a variety of applications, but their innate incompetence is such that anything their technology can do, magic can usually do more quickly and efficiently.
    Tinker gnomes average three feet tall and weigh 45-50 pounds. Females are as large as males. Though short and stocky, tinker gnomes move gracefully, and their hands are deft and sure. They have rich brown skin, curly or straight white hair, china-blue or violet eyes, and straight, cavity-free teeth. Males have soft, curly white beards and moustaches. Both sexes have rounded ears and large noses; they develop facial wrinkles after age 50.
    The voice of a tinker gnome resembles that of a huma , except the timbre is more nasal. Tinker gnomes speak intensely and rapidly, running their words together in unending sentences. They are capable of listening carefully and speaking at the same time. When two gnomes meet, they babble away, answering questions asked by the other as part of the same continuous sentence. Gnomes have learned to speak slowly and distinctly to other races. If frightened or depressed, a gnome may speak in much shorter sentences than usual.
    Tinker gnomes are second only to gully dwarves and goblins as the worst dressers o Ansalon . They wear almost anything that is relatively clean. They especially enjoy scarves, shawls, and hard leather footwear. In their research areas, they wear easily cleaned smocks and coats.
  Combat: |
    Unless they are adventurers, gnomes rarely carry weapons, although some of their tools can be used as weapons. Strange weapons of dubious utility are always being invented. Some, like the three-barrel water blaster, are all but useless, while others, like the multiple spear flinger, show promise.
    Hand-held and light crossbows, slings, short bows, darts, and melee weapons that can be hurled, such as hammers and hand axes, are the gnomes' preferred weapons. Squads of gnomes sometimes operate elaborate catapult-type devices to fire boulders, water bags, or garbage at their enemies. Gnomes wear all types of armor, but typically outfit themselves in a variety of mismatched pieces giving them an effective AC of 5.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Tinker gnomes establish colonies consisting of immense tunnel complexes in secluded mountain ranges. The largest gnome settlement in Ansalon is beneath Mount Nevermind . Other gnome colonies are scattered throughout Krynn in mountainous or rough, hilly regions, but their populations seldom exceed 200-400.
    Mount Nevermind is a scene of nonstop activity and noise. Gnomes scurry from place to place while steam blasts, whistles shriek, gears grind, and lights flash. Hundreds of staircases, ramps, pulley elevators, and ladders cross from level to level. Catapults called gnomeflingers serve as rapid transport, as do steam-powered cars mounted on rails. Beneath the city is a complex network of tunnels and mines that spreads in all directions. This ancient tunnel system, also known as the Undercity, contains the lairs of dangerous monsters and pockets of hostile subterranean races. The gnomes use some of the tunnels as dump sites for hazardous wastes.
    All tinker gnomes belong to a guild. There are perhaps 50 major guilds and a host of minor ones. Hydraulics, Chemistry, Architecture, Hydrodynamics, Kinetics, Mathematics, Weapons, Mechanical Engineering, and Education are among the more popular guilds. Only the Agricultural and Medical Guilds are concerned with life sciences. Scientific guilds without immediate application, such as Astronomy, are usually small and have little influence. Clerical gnomes originally belonged to the Priests Guild, which was the first and only guild to become extinct. Their functions were eventually absorbed by the Medical and Philosophers Guilds.
    All gnomes have a Lifequest: to attain perfect understanding of a single device. Since few have attained this goal, the tinker gnomes are perpetually unfulfilled.
    The gnomes are governed by an elected Grand Council of clan leaders and guild masters. The council members serve for life. Methods of election vary from guild to guild and from clan to clan. The government is so heavily laden with bureaucracy that few major decisions are actually rendered by the Grand Council. Most decisions are made by guilds and clans who have their own agendas, regardless of the wishes of the rest of the community. Everyone insists on strict adherence to regulations, but this process is so time-consuming that even gnomes lack the necessary patience.
    A gnome has three different names. One is the gnome's true name, which is actually an extensive history of the gnome's entire family tree. Though gnomes can easily remember at least the first few thousand letters of their true names, they use a shorter name for routine communication. This name is a simple listing of the highlights of the gnome's ancestry, requiring only half a minute or so to recite. Humans and other races who deal with gnomes have developed even shorter names for them, consisting of the first one or two syllables of their true names. Gnomes consider these abbreviated names undignified, but have learned to live with them.
    Common to any gnomish colony are the sages who record endless volumes of information, guesses, facts, figures, speculations and philosophical doodles detailing their guild committees' various concerns. These records are seldom meaningful to anyone except the authors.
    Reorx is the only deity recognized by the tinker gnomes. Though they have no formal religious services, the gnomes have a healthy respect for their god. Reorx is thought of as an unusually large gnome who epitomizes the gnomish love of creating and tinkering, as evidenced by such inventions as the su and the moons.
    Though most gnomes are content to stay home and tinker with their projects, there are some who can be as adventurous as members of any other race. Adventuring gnomes are generally unable to learn from previous experience and repeat the same mistakes, yet they are often successful in developing quirky solutions to save the day for their companions. Adventurer gnomes are general handymen and jacks-of-all-trades; anything and everything draws their attention, causing them to reach for their notebooks or tool belts.
    But the vast majority of gnomes are devoted to creating new devices. Gnomish inventions are almost exclusively driven by basic mechanical devices, such as gears, windmills, waterwheels, pulleys, and screws, in unnecessarily complicated arrangements. Their sheer love of technology is their downfall, for they improve their inventions to death. Simple solutions are rejected in favor of redundant and ultimately unworkable complications. Needless to say, gnomish technology has had little impact on the cultures of Ansalon.
  Ecology: |
    In general, tinker gnomes are not well-liked by other races. Their technological bent makes them quite alien to those accustomed to magic, and their poor understanding of social relations puts off most potential friends. The Agricultural Guild looks after the gnomes' nutritional needs, maintaining fungi growth farms and herds of cave-dwelling sheep. Research into the creation of artificial foods continues, but so far has produced nothing edible.
  Mad Gnomes: |
    Mad gnomes look like normal tinker gnomes and have similar abilities, but they have no talent for technology. They are almost always from lands far away from Ansalon. The few mad gnomes who have learned technological skills never do their work properly as far as normal gnomes are concerned â€“ their devices work too well.
    All off-world gnomes are considered to be mad gnomes. Krynn gnomes get a yearly dice roll to see if they become mad gnomes. If a 100 is rolled on 1d100, 1d100 is rolled again. If a 100 result occurs again, the gnome becomes a mad gnome. Mad gnomes from Krynn start out with the gnomish technological skills. Off-world mad gnomes have a 1% chance of learning gnomish technological skills during any six-month period spent with normal gnomes; the roll is not cumulative and can be checked only once every six months. Unlike normal tinker gnomes, mad gnomes with technological skills create devices that are elegant and efficient.
    Mad gnomes who can use technology get a +3 bonus to any success roll involved in creating a device. Also, the device is automatically 1d6 sizes smaller than a regular gnomish device of this type.

  Description: |
    Trolls are horrid carnivores found in all climes, from arctic wastelands to tropical jungles. Most creatures avoid these beasts, since trolls know no fear and attack unceasingly when hungry. Their frame appears thin and frail, but trolls possess surprising strength. Their arms and legs are long and ungainly. The legs end in great three-toed feet, the arms in wide, powerful hands with sharpened claws. The trolls' rubbery hide is colored a moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. A writhing hairlike mass grows out of their skulls and is usually greenish black or iron gray in color. Their dull, sunken black eyes possess 90-foot infravision. Females are easily distinguished from males; they are both larger and more powerful than their male counterparts.
    Trolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. The trolls' gait is uneven and, when running, the arms dangle free and drag along the ground. For all this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile. They are masterful climbers and can scale even sheer cliffs with an 80% chance of success. Trolls have a poor hearing, but their sense of smell is superior.
    Trolls have no language of their own, using "trollspeak", a guttural mishmash of common, giant, gobli , orc , and hobgobli . Trollspeak is highly transient and trolls from one area are only 25% likely to be able to communicate with trolls from another.
  Combat: |
    Trolls attack with two clawed hands and their bite, and they can attack at multiple opponents. In the rare case that a troll wields a weapon, it attacks with a +8 damage bonus. Trolls regenerate at an amazing rate. Starting three rounds after first blood, the creatures recover 3 hit points per round until healed. Trolls reduced to 0 or fewer hit points fall to the ground, incapacitated but not slain. Incapacitated trolls continue to regenerate and stand up to fight as soon as they have a positive number of hit points.
    When using an edged weapon, it is possible to sever the thin limbs of a troll (a natural 20 with an edged weapon is needed). Severed limbs continue to fight after separation from the body (hands squeeze, heads bite if stepped on, etc.). Attacks by severed limbs are at normal chances to hit. Separated limbs fight for the remainder of the battle, then scuttle back and rebind with the body once the battle is over. Limbs unable to reach the body die within 24 hours, but this is of little consequence since trolls regenerate lost body parts (including the head) within a week. If a troll is dismembered and scattered, the largest surviving piece regenerates. The others die within one day if they cannot rejoin that piece.
    Only fire and acid cause permanent damage to trolls. These forms of attack destroy its regenerative ability. A troll reduced to 0 or fewer hit points and immersed in acid or burned with fire is killed.
    Trolls have no fear of death, and launch themselves into combat, flailing wildly at their opponents and biting whoever comes closest. They occasionally (25%) throw stones before closing with their victims. Thrown stones have a maximum range of 20 yards, weigh 10 to 20 pounds, and inflict 1d8 points of damage.
    If confronted by a large natural or magical fire, trolls try to find some way around the flames.
    Trolls combine a ravenous appetite with limited intelligence, so they are frequently distracted and break off pursuit 50% of the time to pick up food dropped by fleeing prey.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Trolls can survive in all climes, but prefer dense forests and subterranean locales, since bright sunlight hurts their eyes; trolls suffer no combat penalties because of this. They usually make their lairs in caves, using great boulders to block the entrances. Inside a troll cave are a number of rough nests made of straw and grass, plus scattered bones and treasure from victims. If there are no caves in an area, trolls dig themselves a trollhole and cover its opening with twigs and leaves. Trollholes are usually built near trees and are 90% undetectable. Anyone who steps on a trollhole is 75% likely to fall through the leafy door and tumble into the den below.
    Trolls live in small packs of 3 to 12 trolls led by a dominant female who acts as shaman/chieftain. She casts priest spells at 7th level; spheres typically include Charm, Divination, Sun (Darkness only), and Weather. Leadership is only retained by combat, so fights for pack control are frequent. Often trolls rend each other limb from limb, but these battles are never fatal. Still, it is the custom of trolls to toss the loser's head a great distance from the fight scene, and frequently losers must sit and stew for a week until their new head grows in.
    The pack chieftain's duties are few. She leads the trolls on nightly forages, loping along, sniffing the air for prey. If a scent is found, the trolls charge, racing to get there first, and letting out a great cry once prey is spotted. In return for being the hunt leader, the shaman gets her choice of mates in the pack. Females give birth to a single troll about once every five years.
    Trolls have ravenous appetites, devouring everything from simple grubs to bears and humans . Their lairs are often located near human settlements or along well traveled roads, but not too near, for even trolls respect organized resistance by fire-bearing humans. Wandering trolls, in search of a new lair, travel by night and sleep by day. Ravenous from walking, these packs, on occasion, attack and devour entire humanoid villages.
  Ecology: |
    Trolls prey on all but the most powerful of creatures. They respect and fear dragons , but they hate giants of good alignment and wage war with them frequently. The trolls' green blood is used to manufacture both poison antidotes and healing potions. The blood from one troll, worth 400 gp, can make three such potions.
  Giant Two-Headed Troll: |
    These ferocious troll/ettin crossbreeds posses a mottled greenish brown skin tone, and their dress is usually moth-eaten rags or animal skins. Two-headed trolls use trollspeak as their language.
    Though part ettin, these monsters retain many of the abilities of trolls. They regenerate like trolls, but only 1 hit point a round, and severed limbs cannot reattach (their thicker limbs are not cleaved on a roll of 20). Two-headed trolls attack with two claws and two bites. Both bite attacks are against one opponent, but the claws may be directed against different foes. The troll can, though rarely, wield a weapon with a +6 damage bonus. Like ettins, two-headed trolls are surprised only on a 1. These creatures live in damp, underground caverns and can be found leading groups of their smaller troll cousins.
  Freshwater Troll (Scrag): |
    These gilled trolls, also called scrags or river trolls, are the most loathsome of all the trolls. River trolls, as their name implies, travel the waterways in search of victims. Their arms are thin and frail but their mouths are wide and lined with dozens of needle-sharp fangs. Their color ranges from blue-green to olive. Scrags have all of the abilities of normal trolls, but they only regenerate when immersed in fresh water. Scrags can survive out of water for one hour and often come ashore in search of prey. River trolls devour anything they catch, but prefer humanoids and have a fondness for dwarves.
    Scrags are devious hunters and often carry a few baubles with them. They lay gems near the water's edge and wait for someone to spot them and reach down. Other traps include burying themselves in the sand, in shallow water, and waiting to be stepped on or tangling the rudders of small boats. River trolls occasionally nest beneath bridges or near ferry boats, demanding a toll in exchange for passage. The toll varies, but averages the equivalent of one cow per week, per troll. Livestock and children frequently disappear when river trolls are near. Scrag shamans also have access to Elemental (water) spells.
  Saltwater Troll (Marine Scrag): |
    Like freshwater scrags, marine scrags can breathe air for one hour and have all of the abilities of normal trolls, except they regenerate only when immersed in saltwater. Large, green, and pot-bellied, marine scrags are thick-skinned and heavily scaled. Limp hair, the color of seaweed, hangs down to their shoulders. Their feet are wide and webbed to aid them in swimming. While their limbs are shorter and weaker than those of ordinary trolls, their mouths are larger and filled with hundreds of needle-sharp teeth. Marine scrags can subsist on fish and shellfish, but crave human flesh. They create their lairs in shallow ocean caves or beneath city docks. They emerge from their caves at night, climbing over ship railings in search of sailors or hunting the piers for a strolling couple or a lone drunk. Their attacks are quick and stealthy; they usually hunt in packs of four to six, but occasionally, several dozen may attack a large ship. Marine scrag shamans also have access to Elemental (water) spells.
  Desert Troll: |
    Desert trolls are usually tan, but can modify their color from bleached tan to mottled rock brown, causing a -2 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls. Their keen senses and animal cunning reduce their chances of being surprised to 1-in-10. Like normal trolls, the desert variety usually attacks with two claws and a bite.
    Desert trolls are immune to normal fire, heat, and cold. They do not regenerate acid damage, damage from magical fire, or fire breath weapons. In addition, they suffer damage from normal water that cannot be regenerated. Normal water inflicts 1d4 points of damage per vial, 2d4 points per flask, and 4d4 points per skin. A decanter of endless water aimed directly at a desert troll (successful attack roll required) causes 25 points of damage per round. Purified water (including normal and holy water) causes double damage. A potion of sweet water causes 6d6 points of damage and the troll must make a saving throw vs. poison or die.
    These trolls are tougher and more tenacious than their more common counterparts, but they are also more solitary. They skulk at the edges of settled areas, waylaying travelers and polluting sources of pure water.
  Spectral Troll (Troll Wraith): |
    Spectral trolls, taking material form only in darkness, are tormented by the memory of life. They try to slay all living creatures they encounter. Resembling normal trolls in all respects except color, their jet black skin and hair make them easily distinguishable from other trolls. Spectral trolls have the same attacks as regular trolls and can divide them among many opponents. A silver or magical weapon is needed to attack them, making the final disposition of a spectral troll an even trickier prospect.
    Being undead , spectral trolls can be turned by priests as though they were spectres. It is noted that a humanoid slain by a spectral troll becomes one itself in three days, unless a proper burial ceremony is performed by a priest of the victim's religion.
    Spectral trolls vanish in direct sunlight. They do not take damage from sunlight; they merely fade from view and reappear at the same spot at nightfall. Even those captured, unconscious, or trapped in temporal stasis have escaped permanent imprisonment in this manner.
  Giant Troll: |
    Giant trolls are hideous hill giant/troll crossbreeds. They resemble normal trolls in all respects, except for their unnatural size. Their skin is reddish brown and they have red-rimmed eyes.
    Despite their pot-bellied appearance, giant trolls are immensely strong and inflict damage like a hill giant when they are using their favorite weapon of attack â€“ a large spiked club made from a tree trunk or a house timber. These clubs cause 2d6+7 points of damage. In those rare instances when a giant troll has no weapons, its claws inflict 1d6+1 points of damage; as with all trolls, the claw attacks can be divided among different opponents as necessary.
    Instead of using their claws to attack, weaponless giant trolls are more likely to grab medium-sized prey in their large hands and wield the struggling victim like a club, beating a new target with the body. Refer to the rules on hand-to-hand combat in the Dungeon Master's Guide for guidelines.
    Giant trolls who are overwhelmed by many small- and medium-sized opponents take time to grab and hurl the warriors into nearby trees, leaving more time to deal with the softer, weaker enemies. Note that, like hill giants, giant trolls can catch missiles 25% of the time, if in reach, and can hurl boulders that cause 2d8 points of damage.
    Unlike normal trolls and their closer relatives, giant trolls never attack with their bite. This is due to the fact that they are much taller than the meals they like best (humanoids, of course), and they find it difficult to bend forward with the flexibility normal trolls enjoy. Then too, the head of a giant troll, more than any other part of the cross-breed anatomy, is almost identical to that of a hill giant, except that their skin is reddish brown. The giant troll also lacks the razor sharp teeth of normal trolls that strike fear in so many.
    Giant trolls regenerate damage as normal trolls, but at the rate of 2 hit points per round. They cannot reattach severed limbs. Before a giant troll can be killed, at least 10 points of damage must be inflicted on it by fire. If this condition is not met, and the giant troll is reduced to a single hit point, further damage has no effect, except to prevent regeneration.
    They have a very acute sense of smell and 90-foot infravision. Giant trolls are feared throughout the world, for not only do they possess the horrible ability to regenerate damage inflicted upon them, but they also possess the power and strength of hill giants (fearsome in their own right). The combination is a deadly one, and, even worse, giant trolls travel in loose tribal bands of 1d12 members. They are rarely encountered alone. Lairs of giant trolls are always served by 2d6 normal trolls who act as simple lackeys (and sometimes food) for their larger cousins.
    Giant trolls are found in nearly every clime. Giant trolls are on good terms with strong hill giant tribes, for which they serve as elite personal guardians for the ruling chief.
  Ice Troll: |
    The ice troll is a smaller, more intelligent relative of the normal troll, and is probably the result of magical experimentation. It closely resembles its more common cousin, but has semitransparent, very cold skin. Ice trolls are famous for being cunning, evil creatures which keep humans and demi-humans as livestock. Because ice trolls need water to regenerate, they never leave their lakes and rivers, and will create elaborate traps to lure their prey to them.
    Ice trolls are organized and intelligent enough to know their weaknesses, and rarely start a fight at a disadvantage. Unlike their larger and less intelligent cousins, they do not wade into combat blindly, but will try to pick off weaker opponents one by one, hoping to bring back live prey. Ice trolls generally attack with claws for 1d8 hit points of damage each, but have been known to use weapons on rare occasions (10%), at an additional +4 to each weapon's damage due to Strength. Attacks may be directed against different opponents.
    The regenerative powers of ice trolls are not as great as normal trolls. An ice troll must be immersed in water to be able to regenerate 2 hit points per melee round. The creatures often make their stand in a shallow pool of water to keep this advantage.
    Because of the thin, brittle nature of the ice troll, it is possible to sever one of the creature's limbs with an edged weapon, on a natural attack roll of 20 with an edged weapon. Severed limbs also regenerate 2 hit points per turn, as long as they are immersed in water. If a severed limb is not in contact with water, it will move up to 30 feet in search of water, always moving toward it, if it is in range.
    Fire and acid are the only attack forms which negate the ice troll's ability to regenerate. Because of the ice troll's physiology, fire-based attacks do double damage. Ice trolls are unaffected by cold or cold-based spells, and because of their magical nature, can only be hit by magical weapons or missiles.
    Ice trolls live in groups of 7-12 in arctic and sub-arctic regions, near open water. Because they are smaller and less resilient than their larger cousins, they have developed a higher sense of cooperation to stay alive. Each group has a leader, usually the most intelligent. Leaders are responsible for keeping the group safe and well-fed.
    Ice trolls live near settled regions, hoping to waylay and capture humans and demi-humans. Ice trolls will frequently bait traps for adventurers, using treasure they have salvaged from previously waylaid groups. Settlements also provide more common livestock, which, although less preferable than human flesh, is considered edible in times of need.
    Ice trolls establish their lairs near lakes or rivers. Here the ice trolls will have gathered all their treasure, as well as 5-20 human or demi-human captives. These prisoners are kept well-fed on grains and vegetables, so that the ice trolls need never go too long without food.
    Ice trolls mate in the spring and give birth to one baby ice troll in the late fall. When an ice troll tribe gets too large, it splits, one group wandering off to find a new lair. Ice trolls that live in arctic regions often hunt remorhaz, and will even pick off a solitary frost giant. Ice troll blood is frequently used in the manufacture of frost brand swords, and rings of cold resistance.
  Spirit Troll: |
    The spirit troll is an odious mutation of the spectral troll. Several schools of thought completely separate this creature from the spectral variety, presenting evidence that the spirit troll is a perverted magical interbreeding of trolls and invisible stalkers. The spirit troll is invisible; characters able to see invisible objects observe it to be very similar to a troll, slightly shorter and with diffused features. The spirit troll can only be hit by magical weapons. Fire inflicts full damage, but it is invulnerable to cold-based attacks. It regenerates as does a troll, and at the same rate. It attacks with its fangs and two sharp claws, against three different opponents if it so desired. The damage inflicted by its fangs (2d4+2) is normal damage, except that the spirit troll adds the damage to its own hit points â€“ in effect healing itself! The damage inflicted by the spirit troll's claws (1d4+2) is taken not only from the victim's hit points but also from Strength. Strength points lost in this way are recovered in 2d4 turns. If a character's Strength is reduced to 0, the PC dies. If the Strength is reduced to 1 or 2 points, the PC is rendered comatose, only recovering when (and if) sufficient hit points are recovered to raise the Strength to 3 or more. The spirit troll has an acute sense of smell and superior, 120-foot-range infravision.

  Description: |
    Ulitharids, or Noble Illithid , are the elite of mind flayers, favored by their god the elder brain and free to exercise their will upon lower illithids and all other humanoids that fall under their power.
    Ulitharids tower over their lesser kin by more than a foot, standing 7Â½ feet tall. They are colored similarly to other illithids, but they are darker than normal mind flayers. They have six writhing tentacles surrounding their mouths, not four like their common underlings, which are filled with sawlike teeth. Like most mind flayers, ulitharids dress in robes that cover their grotesque bodies from the ground to the neck, and high-crowned headdresses are not uncommon.
    With their incredible intellect, ulitharids can understand the spoken language of many races, but their mouths are ill-suited for speech. Of course, they can communicate freely with any creature through the use of their innate telepathy.
  Combat: |
    The ulitharid's six faceted tentacles are much stronger than those of normal illithids, so the monster requires only 1d3 rounds to reach a victim's brain, once the tentacles have taken hold of the victim's head. Each tentacle inflicts 1d4 points of damage upon a successful hit (at which point the tentacle has seized the victim's head unless the DM rules otherwise), and only three tentacles are needed to establish a grip that allows the creature to begin boring into the opponent's head in quest of his brains.
    A ulitharid's mind blast is also much than more deadly than its common counterpart. It has the same area of effect as a normal mind blast â€“ a cone 60 feet long, 5 feet wide at its point of origin, and 20 feet wide at its terminus â€“ but those who fail to save vs. spell with a -4 penalty become feebleminded (as per the 5th-level wizard spell).
    Ulitharids also have the following spell-like powers which they can employ, one at a time, once per round, as a 10th-level wizard: astral projectio , charm perso , charm monster , ESP , eyebite , forget , legend lore , levitate , plane shift , suggestio , telekinesis , and true seeing . All saving throws vs. these powers are rolled with -4 penalties. Ulitharids can also heal up to 25 points of personal damage per day. This process requires a full round to occur, during which the ulitharid must pause and concentrate fully upon healing.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Ulitharids are the noble folk of illithid society. About one in every 25 illithid tadpoles matures into a ulitharid. The ulitharids become caretakers for the community's elder brain, ambassadors to other illithid cities, and leaders of small illithid villages or outposts. A few sages believe that they answer to even more powerful illithids, although none of these beings have ever been seen by surface dwellers.
  Ecology: |
    Ulitharids live twice as long as normal illithids, or about 250 years. They also spend twice as much time in the tadpole state. Ulitharids are among the most feared creatures of the subterranean world, and few creatures will challenge them.

  Description: |
    Umber hulks are powerful subterranean predators whose ironlike claws allow them to burrow through solid stone in search of prey.
    Umber hulks are tremendously strong, standing nearly 8 feet tall and over 5 feet wide. Muscles bulge beneath their thick, scaly hides and their powerful arms and legs all carry great claws. They have no necks to speak of, but the head features a powerful maw with rows of triangular teeth and 8-inch mandibles capable of biting through any hide or bone. Most peculiar of all are the four round eyes, spaced evenly across each umber hulk's forehead. Umber hulks are black, shading to a lighter shade of yellowish gray on the front. Their eyes are mere blackened dots each the size of a small coin. Umber hulks have their own language.
  Combat: |
    For all of their monstrous features, umber hulks are intelligent opponents. They usually dig to a point adjacent to a main corridor, then wait, peeking through a crack they've made, until likely prey walks by. The umber hulk then springs out upon its startled victim. When using this technique, opponents have a -5 modifier on their surprise rolls. Other tactics involve planned cave-ins and dead-end tunnels where an umber hulk can wait for victims to come to him. Their burrowing rate varies from 10 feet per turn in solid stone to 60 feet per turn in soft earth.
    In melee, umber hulks can deliver a vicious bite but, understandably, their main weapon is their great claws. Worse, looking into an umber hulk's eyes causes confusion , as per the spell, unless a saving throw versus spell is made. In addition to this special confusion attack the outer eyes of an umber hulk provide the creature with infravision to a distance of 90 feet.
    The one saving grace when fighting an umber hulk is their speed. Their gait is slow and ponderous and their balance is poor in wide spaces.
    Umber hulks never fight to the death unless cornered (which is rare, since the creature can dig through stone). If hard pressed, an umber hulk won't hesitate to cause a cave-in (25% chance of success per round) and then dig his way to freedom.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Umber hulks dwell in the depths of the earth. They raid dungeons for food, much the way anteaters raid ant colonies, eating their fill and then moving on to let the "colony" recover.
    Umber hulks are usually solitary hunters. Males and females mate, then go their separate ways. One to three young are born about a year later in a special nursery which has been hollowed out by the female. Two years later, once the hulklings are big enough, the female begins taking them with her when hunting. It is during this period that unfortunate victims may stumble across more than one umber hulk at a time.
    No umber hulk culture is known, but it is rumored that there may be entire cities of these beings underground with tunnels that radiate out, like threads in a spider's web, toward the nearer dungeons and mountain ranges. If true, this would explain much, for umber hulks seem to disappear or spring up in a region at will and always take great care in hiding their tunnels behind them.
  Ecology: |
    Umber hulks eat young purple worms, ankhegs, and similar creatures. Their favorite prey, however, is humankind.
  Vodyanoi: |
    These aquatic predators are closely related to the umber hulk. Vodyanoi live in deep bodies of fresh water. They are similar in appearance to umber hulks but have only two eyes and thus lack the ability to confuse opponents. Their skin is green and slimy to the touch, but beneath it is a thick, knobby hide. Their claws are webbed. Vodyanoi prey upon all manner of creatures but prefer huma flesh. They can rend the hulls of small vessels and frequently sink or overturn small boats. Once per day a vodyanoi can attempt to summon 1-20 electric eels with a 50% chance of success. The existence of a saltwater variety of vodyanoi of twice the size and greater ferocity is rumored but unconfirmed.

  Description: |
    Of all the chaotic evil undead creatures that stalk the world, none is more dreadful than the vampire. Moving silently through the night, vampires prey upon the living without mercy or compassion. Unless deep underground, they must return to the coffins in which they pass the daylight hours, and even in the former case they must occasionally return to such to rest, for their power is renewed by contact with soil from their graves.
    One aspect that makes the vampire far more fearful than many of its undead kindred is its appearance. Unlike other undead creatures, the vampire can easily pass among normal me without drawing attention to itself for, although its facial features are sharp and feral, they do not seem inhuman. In many cases, a vampire's true nature is revealed only when it attacks.
    There are ways in which a vampire may be detected by the careful observer, however. Vampires cast no reflection in a glass, cast no shadows, and move in complete silence.
  Combat: |
    When engaging in combat, vampires are savage and fearsome opponents. They are physically very powerful, with a Strength score of 18/76, receiving a bonus of +2 to hit and +4 to damage. The crushing blows of a vampire's attack are so fierce that they inflict 5-10 points of damage.
    The gaze of a vampire is one of its most powerful and dangerous weapons. Any person who allows the vampire to look into his eyes will be affected as if by a charm perso spell. Due to the power of this enchantment, a -2 is applied to the victim's saving throw vs. spell. In this manner, vampires are often able to pass posted sentries and surprise their chosen victims.
    Like all undead creatures, vampires exist in both the Positive Material and Negative Material planes at the same time. Their powerful negative essence allows them to drain two life energy levels from anyone they strike. If the vampire is making use of some form of weapon in the attack, it cannot employ this power.
    Weapons of less than +1 enchantment pass through vampires without harming them in any way. Even if attacked with and harmed by magical weapons, vampires regenerate 3 hit points per round. If reduced to zero hit points, a vampire is not destroyed, but is forced to assume gaseous form . Once in this state, it will attempt to flee and return to its coffin where, after eight hours of rest, it regains its corporeal form. If the defeated vampire is unable to reach its coffin within 12 turns, however, its essence breaks up and the creature is truly destroyed.
    Sleep , charm , and hold spells do not affect vampires. Similarly, they are unharmed by poisons and immune to paralysis. Spells that are based on cold or electricity cause only half damage.
    At will, vampires are able to disperse their bodies into clouds of elemental vapor and assume gaseous form . In this state, they are all but immune to attack and can escape from almost any confinement. In addition, vampires can shape change so as to take on the form of a large bat (hence the flying movement rate given above).
    Vampires can summon lesser creatures for aid. In a subterranean environment, they will typically call forth a swarm of 10-100 rats or bats. In the case of the latter, these do not physically attack but serve to confuse and obscure the vision of the vampire's foes. In the wilderness, a vampire will normally call upon 3-18 wolves for assistance. In all cases, the summoned animals arrive in 2-12 rounds.
    At will, a vampire can use a spider climb ability and scale sheer surfaces. Often, they will employ this power to gain access to rooms on upper floors without alerting those on watch downstairs. This power also permits the vampire to seek refuge in places which are all but beyond the reach of mortal men.
    Despite the great powers which vampires obviously possess, they are not without weaknesses of their own. The odor of strong garlic repels them and they will not approach it. Further, they will recoil from the face of a mirror or lawful good holy symbol if either of these is presented to them with courage and conviction. It is important to understand, however, that this will not actually harm the vampire in any way nor drive it off. Garlic will prevent the creature from attacking or entering the area, while mirrors and holy symbols force the vampire to find some means of removing the offending object before it can be bypassed. In most cases, the vampire will seek to overcome these hazards with the aid of its minions. For example, a charmed person might be called upon to attack someone who is holding the vampire at bay with a holy symbol. Another important point to keep in mind is that a lawful good holy symbol will affect the vampire regardless of the vampire's original religious background. Vampires which are splashed with a vial of holy water or struck with lawful good holy symbols are burned by them, suffering 2-7 points of damage.
    Just as vampires can be kept at bay, so too can they be slain by those who have the knowledge to do so. Any vampire which is exposed to direct sunlight is instantly rendered powerless and, after one round, utterly annihilated. If the vampire can be immersed in running water, it loses one-third of its hit points each round, until destroyed on the third round. Last, a vampire can be killed by having a wooden stake driven through its heart. In this case, however, the creature can be restored simply by removing the stake if further measures are not taken to ensure the fate of the vampire. In order for it to be completely destroyed, the vampire's head must be cut off and its mouth stuffed with holy wafers (or their equivalent).
    In addition to its aversion to items like garlic and holy symbols, the vampire acts under many other limitations. One of the most powerful of these is the creature's inability to enter a home without being first invited to do so by a resident of the dwelling. This does not apply to public buildings and places of business which, by their very nature, extend an "invitation" to all. Once a vampire has been invited to enter a residence, it may come and go freely afterward. A common manner for obtaining permission to enter a home is the use of the vampire's gaze to charm a servant or other inhabitant.
    Any human or humanoid creature slain by the life energy drain of a vampire is doomed to become a vampire himself. Thus, those who would hunt these lords of the undead must be very careful lest they find themselves condemned to a fate far worse than death. The transformation takes place one day after the burial of the creature. Those who are not actually buried, however, do not become undead and it is thus traditional that the bodies of a vampire's victims be burned or similarly destroyed. Once they become undead, the new vampire is under the complete control of its killer. If that vampire is destroyed, the controlled undead are freed from its power and become self-willed creatures.
    In most cases, vampires do not lose the abilities and knowledge which they had in life when they become undead. Thus, it is possible for a vampire to have the powers of, for example, a wizard, thief, or even priest. In all cases, of course, the new vampire becomes chaotic evil.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Vampires live in areas of death and desolation where they will not be reminded of the lives they have left behind. Ruined castles or chapels and large cemeteries are popular lairs for them, as are sites of great tragedies or battles. Vampires often feel a strong attachment to specific areas with some morbid significance, like the grave of a suicide or the site of a murder.
    When deciding on a course of action or planning a campaign, vampires move very slowly and meticulously. It is not uncommon for a vampire to undertake some scheme which may take decades or even centuries to reach its conclusion. Because of the curse of immortality that has fallen upon them, they feel that time is always on their side and will often defeat foes who might otherwise overcome them; the vampire can simply go into hiding for a few decades until the passing of the years brings down its enemies.
    Vampires are normally solitary creatures. When they are found in the company of others of their kind, the group will certainly consist of a single vampire lord and a small group of vampires which it has created to do its bidding. In this way, the vampire can exert its power over a greater range without running the risk of exposing itself to attack by would-be heroes.
    In general, vampires feel only contempt for the world and its inhabitants. Denied the pleasures of a true life, they have become dark and twisted creatures bent on revenge and terror. When a vampire creates another of its kind, it considers the new creature a mere tool. The minion will be sent on missions which the vampire feels may be too dangerous or unimportant for its personal attention. If the need arises, these pawns will gladly be sacrificed to protect or further the ends of their master.
  Ecology: |
    The vampire has no place in the world of living creatures. It is a thing of darkness that exists only to bring about evil and chaos. Almost without exception, the vampire is feared and hated by those who dwell in the regions in which it chooses to make its home. The vampire's unnatural presence is all-pervasive and will cause dogs and similar animals to raise a cry of alarm at the presence of the creature.
    Vampires sustain themselves by draining the life force from living creatures. Unless they have a specific need to create additional minions, however, they are careful to avoid killing those they attack. In cases where the death of a victim is desired, the vampire will take care to see that the body is destroyed and thus will not rise as an undead.
    Vampires are divided into age categories. Essentially, a vampire's power grows as it ages â€“ the creature gains new abilities that it did not previously have and becomes less susceptible. In short, the older a vampire becomes, the more formidable a foe it becomes. Each age category has a title associated with it (ages refer to the number of years the creature has been a vampire).
    These titles are more of an academic interest than any practical value, as one would not normally refer to vampires by any of the above titles. For example, Strahd von Zarovich falls into the "ancient" category, but one who calls him "Ancient Strahd", rather than "Lord Strahd", will not live long to rue to the error.
    Vampires with 10 HD are turned as ghosts, those with 11+ HD are turned as liches.
    * These values are minima. If the vampire had greater ability scores prior to becoming undead, the higher scores are retained. Vampires, regardless of age, have a Constitution score of at least 18.
â€¡ Despite any resistance or immunity to sunlight, the vampire still loathes it and will seek shade or take cover if possible.
â€¡â€¡ These are cumulative with age; vampires immune to holy symbols are not immune to being turned.
  Eastern Vampire: |
    This breed of vampire is, if anything, even more frightful than its western cousin. Although they share many of the western vampire's strengths and weaknesses, they have the ability to fade from sight at will. Once they have become invisible , they receive all of the normal bonuses which such a state normally bestows, including being attacked at -4. These monsters are unable to charm their victims, however, and cannot assume gaseous form at will as western vampires can.

  Description: |
    Magically-created creations of Vulkara 's breeders , Vodoni enforcers are half- ma , half-wolf beast-warriors who have been infected with a special Vodoni form of lycanthropy. Normally, the enforcers appear as wolf-like humanoids, but whenever they go into a blood rage (i.e. berserk) the enforcers take on a decidedly rabid appearance.
  Combat: |
    Enforcers are tremendous fighting machines, honed to battle for glorious honor and their very existence. In their calmer moments, they attack twice each round; and are usually armed with longswords +1.
    However, at the beginning of any battle, there is a 75% chance that the enforcers will choose to take the more violent and horrible road to victory. By attacking with both claws and their vicious bite, enforcers quickly turn even more wolf-like in appearance and manner and go utterly berserk in combat. This dread phenomena is known throughout the empire as the Vodoni blood rage.
    Any enforcer whose bite hits will go into a blood rage if he fails a Wisdom check (the success roll is usually 8 or less!). This is called "tasting blood". An enforcer that goes berserk doubles its normal number of attacks per round, gains a +2 to hit, and inflicts +4 damage. As the warrior is now completely out of control, its weapons aren't used; leaving only enhanced hand-to-hand attacks. Also, the armor class of a berserk enforcer drops by four places, due to the complete lack of even basic defensive precautions.
    The blood rage lasts 1 turn after the last blood has been tasted. By instinct, enforcers do not attack other enforcers, but do gnaw on vanquished foes if there are no more living enemies to battle.
    The Vodoni form of lycanthropy is more virulent than the common strain, in that the victims are nearly mindless and vicious unless further treated. The chances of contracting lycanthropy are the same as for the more common form. Demihumans and nonhumans must make a special save vs. poison to survive contracting it, and suffer its full effects if they do. Cure disease is ineffective against this strain of lycanthropy.
  Habitat/Society: |
    During every cosmic moo cycle (i.e. 30 standard days); the enforcers lose complete control at the height of the full moon. At this time, they are often let loose upon uncooperative worlds . This natural blood rage lasts until dawn breaks, and during this time only, enforcer will attack enforcer. The enforcers themselves refer to this period as "shore leave."
  Ecology: |
    Enforcers are made, not born, in the horrid pits of the Undercity. The victims are first infected with lycanthropy (during the full moon feasts of the Imperial City, for example) and then taken to the Undercity. At this point Vodoni lycanthropes are nearly mindless, and extremely vicious. The strongest are selected for "testing", which involves swallowing a virulent poison. A successful saving throw vs. poison creates a loyal new Vodoni enforcer; failure means death. To return an enforcer to human status, the creature must have the following spells cast on it at the appropriate time: neutralize poison , remove curse , and heal.
  Vodoni Conquerors: |
    Big, bad, and wolf-like, these monsters are the next stage in enforcer evolution. They are much like the enforcers except that they are even larger and more powerful. When using weapons they inflict an additional +2 points of damage. They have the ability go into blood rage at will. They still suffer the same armor class penalties as their smaller cousins.
    These creatures are currently the secret elite bodyguards for Vulkaran himself, but a few can be found on special missions. Naturally, Vulkaran has decided to devote more of his funds and time to producing even more of these ultra-powerful warriors for his legions. Eventually, the emperor intends to replace the enforcers with the conquerors as the former warriors die over the normal course of events.

  Description: |
    Whales are the largest sea mammals. They are highly intelligent creatures that occupy a number of ecological niches. The common whales include plankton eaters like blue or hump-backed whales and carnivores like sperm whales.
    Common whales range in size from a 10-foot-long calf to 110-foot-long blue whales. The skin is normally blue-gray. Whales share a common language that is difficult for land creatures to learn since it uses tones below huma hearing.
  Combat: |
    All common whales can attack with their tails. These can deliver a crushing blow that inflicts damage equal to half the whale's Hit Dice.
    Plankton-feeding whales can attack with either of their flukes (fins). Whales of 12-17 HD cause 1d8 points of damage, those of 18-24 HD inflict 3d8 points, and those of 24-36 HD cause 5d8 points.
    Carnivorous whales can bite. Whales of 12-17 HD inflict 5d4 points of damage, those of 18-24 HD cause 1d4Ã—10 points, and those of 24-36 HD inflict 3d4Ã—5 points.
    Whales are vulnerable to surface ships only when the whales are on the surface.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Whales live in tribal gatherings called pods. They maintain strong personal and family ties. Their culture is based on complex songs that can be heard for miles underwater. Whales are curious about humanoids but if attacked they can become deadly foes. Whales rarely initiate combat. Whales are curious about other intelligent beings. They welcome communication with other beings. They do not lie, but they may not reveal everything they know.
    Most whales feed on a variety of plankton, shrimp, and small fish that they suck up as they swim along. Sperm whales feed on larger fish, octopi, and especially giant squids.
    Whale cows normally give birth to a single calf. Twins occur in 5% of births. The calf remains with the cow for the next five to ten years, depending on the species. After five years, the cow may give birth again. The calves are protected and taught by all members of the pod.
  Ecology: |
    Although they are neutral in alignment toward humanoids, their alignment toward sea life is generally lawful good. With their great size, power, and diversity, they are the masters of the sea. They preserve order through their conflicts with evilly inclined sea monsters.
    Unfortunately, their relations with seafarers are less certain. Because of the value placed on parts of the whale's body, the creatures are hunted to excess by greedy whalers. Despite the hostility of the humanoids, whales remain curious and basically friendly toward non-whaling seafarers.
    The carcass of a common whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die, both for its meat and blubber. Whales possess a stinking, yellow mass called ambergris that is valuable for making perfumes; they vomit this up when ill. The ambergris is worth 1d20 Ã— 1,000 gp.
  Giant Whale: |
    Giant whales are immense versions of sperm whales, 100' to 400' long. In the cetacean culture, they serve functions similar to knights or barons by protecting common whales against evil sea monsters and whalers. Giant whales are attended by 2d4 common whales.
    Giant whales attack by biting or crushing. Whales of 18-25 HD inflict 1d4Ã—10 points of damage, those of 26-35 HD cause 2d4Ã—10 points, and those of 36-54 HD inflict 3d4Ã—10 points. The tail can deliver a crushing blow that inflicts damage equal to half the whale's Hit Dice. Giant whales can ram the sides of surface ships, delivering a crushing blow that, if successful, sinks the ship. They can also leap halfway out of the water and fall onto a target vessel (50% chance of success). If successful, the ship is immediately driven under the surface. If a giant whale is facing an opponent under 20 feet long, it can swallow the target intact on an attack roll that is 4 or more greater than it needs to hit.
    Their stomachs contain large air chambers in which a victim might survive until he escapes or is digested. The stomach acid is diluted by seawater; characters or objects trapped in the stomach gain a +1 bonus to saving throws vs. this acid. A swallowed character suffers 2 points of damage per round (1 if the saving throw is successful each round) from the acid. The stomach might contain undigested possessions of previous meals. Each type of treasure has a 1% chance per Hit Die (of the whale) of being present in the giant whale's gullet. There may be 1,000-3,000 coins of each type, 1d20 gems, or 1d4 magical items.
    The carcass of a giant whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The ambergris is worth 2d20 Ã— 1,000 gp.
  Leviatha: |
    The leviathan is an almost unimaginably immense whale, 500 to 1,000 feet long. It is the lord of all whales and the intermediary between cetaceans and the gods. Under normal conditions, only one leviathan dwells in each ocean. The leviathan is not always active. It may hibernate for years on the ocean floor. During these long sleeps, the leviathan is attended and protected by its entourage of other whales. The leviathan awakens if summoned by the needs of other whales or in answer to a divine request. Leviathans are awesome foes with a variety of attacks. Their bite damage is determined by their Hit Dice. Leviathans of 24-35 HD inflict 3d4Ã—5 points of damage, those of 36-47 HD cause 3d4Ã—10 points, and those of 48-72 HD inflict 3d4Ã—15 points. The tail can deliver a crushing blow that causes damage equal to half the whale's Hit Dice. On an attack roll that is 4 or more greater than it needs to hit, a leviathan is capable of swallowing a target up to 80 feet long. When attacking a mass of surface vessels, the leviathan creates a powerful wave by swimming deep, rushing to the surface, and leaping halfway out of the water. The resulting wave causes every ship within 500 feet to roll a saving throw vs. crushing blow and every ship within 500 to 2,000 feet to roll a saving throw vs. normal blow. Ships that fail a saving throw immediately sink.
    Once each century, leviathans gather in arctic waters to confer and to mate. This gathering lasts six months. Each leviathan is attended by 2d10 giant whales and 10d10 whales of other species.
    The stomach of a leviathan contains air pockets that are capable of sustaining a victim until he escapes or is digested. The stomach may also contain undigested possessions of previous meals or even sea vessels. Each type of treasure has a 1% chance per Hit Die (of the whale) of being present in the giant whale's gullet. There may be 2,000-6,000 coins of each type, 5d20 gems, or 1d8 magical items.
    The carcass of a leviathan is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The ambergris is worth 4d20 Ã— 1,000 gp. However, the killing of a leviathan will result in every whale within that ocean converging on the killer to avenge their lord's death.
  Killer Whale (Orca): |
    The killer whale is one of the largest predatory sea mammals. It is a deadly killer able to hold its own against all but the most powerful sea monsters. A killer whale is likely to attack humanoids; it is capable of swallowing a man whole, should the need arise.
    Killer whales measure 15 to 30 feet long. Their black bodies are marked by a brilliant white belly and markings that vary from individual to individual.
    Killer whales are not inherently hostile and do not attack unless hungry or provoked. There is a 20% chance that encountered killer whales are hungry. If they are communicated with rather than attacked, killer whales may prefer to talk rather than feed.
    The killer whale's diet consists of both fish and warm-blooded animals. It is a crafty hunter that can recognize the shadows and sounds made by animals atop ice floes. It will break through the ice to visually confirm the presence of prey. Smaller ice floes are rammed and shattered to force the prey into the water. When the killer whale smashes into the ice, every being on the ice must roll a saving throw vs. paralyzation. Failure means the being has slipped into the water and can be attacked the following round.
    When a killer whale makes a successful hit, its prey is held in its jaws where it can automatically bite each round. Victims risk drowning in two to four rounds and the loss of 1 point of Strength and Dexterity per round, due to the numbing effect of the icy water. When either Strength or Dexterity reaches 0, the victim dies.
    The killer whale's main weapon is its terrible bite. Killer whales of 9-10 HD inflict 4d6 points of damage, while those of 11-12 HD cause 6d4 points.
    When hunting larger creatures, the pod acts together to bring down prey of up to 100 feet in length.
    Most pods consist only of adults, but 25% of encountered pods also have 1d8 calves (2-5 HD, swim 15, bite for 2d4). Adults defend their calves to the death. They also assist each other.
    Although killer whales prey on other whales, they also act as their protectors by battling other sea monsters that might decimate the entire cetacean family. Killer whales may enter into alliances with aquatic elves.
    The carcass of a killer whale is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The ambergris is worth 1d10 Ã— 500 gp.
  Narwhal: |
    The narwhal is common to cold, subarctic waters. It is called the "unicorn of the sea" because of the 6- to 12-foot-long spiral horn that the narwhal uses to dig into the sea floor for shellfish. If a narwhal is provoked, the horn can also be used like a lance to attack. When a narwhal attacks with its horn, its Hit Dice determine the damage caused. A narwhal of 4+4 HD inflicts 2d12 points of damage, one of 5+5 HD causes 6d4 points, and one of 6+6 HD inflicts 7d4 points. Only a male can develop this horn. A female attacks by ramming headfirst into its target, inflicting 2d4 points of damage.
    Narwhals are basically peaceful creatures. They may serve as companions or guards for dolphins. They may also be trained and used by aquatic elves.
    The carcass of a narwhal is worth 100 gp per Hit Die. The ivory is worth 1d4Ã—10 gp. The ambergris is worth 1d10 Ã— 200 gp.

  Description: |
    In ages long past, the word "wight" meant simply "man". As the centuries have passed, though, it has come to be associated only with those undead that typically inhabit barrow mounds and catacombs.
    From a distance, wights can easily be mistaken for any number of humanoid races. Upon closer examination, however, their true nature becomes apparent. As undead creatures, wights are nightmarish reflections of their former selves, with cruel, burning eyes set in mummified flesh over a twisted skeleton with hands that end in sharp claws.
  Combat: |
    Wights are fierce and deadly foes in combat. When attacked, they are unharmed by any weapons that are not forged from silver or enchanted in some manner.
    The wight attacks with its jagged claws and powerful blows, inflicting 1-4 points of damage with each successful strike. In addition to this physical harm, the wight is able to feed on the life essence of its foes. Each blow that the wight lands drains one level from the victim, reducing Hit Dice, class bonuses, spell abilities, and so forth. Thus, a 9th-level wizard struck by a wight loses 1-4 hit points and becomes an 8th-level wizard; he has the spells and hit points of an 8th-level wizard and he fights as an 8th-level wizard.
    Persons who are slain by the energy draining powers of a wight are doomed to rise again as wights under the direct control of their slayer. In their new form, they have the powers and abilities of a normal wight but half their experience levels, class abilities, and Hit Dice. If the wight who "created" them is slain, they will instantly be freed of its control and gain a portion of its power, acquiring the normal 4+3 Hit Dice of their kind. Once a character becomes a wight, recovery is nearly impossible, requiring a special quest.
    Wights are unaffected by sleep , charm , hold or cold-based spells. In addition, they are not harmed by poisons or paralyzation attacks.
    Wights can be engaged and defeated by individuals who are well prepared for battle with them. Physical contact with holy water is deadly to wights and each vial splashed on one burns it for 2-8 points of damage. In addition, a raise dead spell becomes a powerful weapon if used against the wight. Such magic is instantly fatal to the creature, utterly annihilating it.
    Wights cannot tolerate bright light, including sunlight, and avoid it at all costs. It is important to note, however, that wights are not harmed by exposure to sunlight as vampires are.
  Habitat/Society: |
    Like the other undead that infest the world, wights live in barrow mounds, catacombs, and other sepulchral places. They despise light and places which are vibrant with living things. As a rule, the wight is hateful and evil, seeking to satisfy its hatred of life by killing all those it encounters.
    Although wights are often found in small groups, they are actually solitary creatures. Without exception, encounters with multiple wights will be a single leader and a number of lesser creatures which it has created to serve it. In these cases, the leader of the group will be more than willing to sacrifice some or all of its minions to assure its own survival or victory.
  Ecology: |
    Like all undead, wights exist on both the Prime Material and Negative Material planes simultaneously. It is this powerful link to the negative world that gives them their fearsome level-draining ability. Further, it is this draining which provides them with sustenance.
    As they are not living creatures and have no rightful place in our world, many animals can sense the wight's presence. Dogs will growl or howl with alarm, horses will refuse to enter an area which wights inhabit, and birds and insects will grow silent when the creature passes near them. In addition, their presence will gradually cause the plant life around their lairs to wither and die, marking the region as unclean.

  Description: |
    The grell is an underground-dwelling, levitating jellyfish. This fearsome carnivore is feared for its ability to strike quickly before any defense can be set up.
    The body of a grell is basically spherical and about five feet in diameter. It is clearly divided into two lobes, left and right. Its drab olive colored flesh is streaked with white. Various lumps, ridges, and veins give the appearance of an exposed brain. A ten-inch-long beak protrudes from one side, just above the base and directly on the major division of the lobes.
    The base of the body is fringed with hundreds of one- to three-inch-long tentacles. Ten six-foot-long tentacles trail from the bottom of the body. Each pale green tentacle is as thick as a man's arm, and has many small spines along the inner surface.
    The grell cannot talk, but it does emit bird-like squeaks and squawks. It is completely silent in motion and when attacking. It has a light, musky smell; its lair has a foul reek of stale carrion.
  Combat: |
    The grell has an average huma intelligence, which it uses to decide on strategy and tactics in combat. It will not attack a party or individual that would obviously kill it.
    Its most common strategy is to float up out of sight near a ceiling and wait. It can move sideways at a movement rate of 4 by waving its tentacles to create small air currents. If it can contact a surface, the extra purchase grants it the full movement rate. It rises or falls at its stated movement rate.
    When a victim walks underneath it, the grell drops down silently, usually with surprise (-3 penalty to opponent's surprise roll). It attacks with all ten tentacles. Each tentacle that hits gets a grip on the victim and remains anchored. For each hit, the victim must roll a saving throw vs. paralysis, with a +4 bonus. If two or more tentacles are gripping the victim, the grell can lift its prey into the air (at half its normal movement rate). Once its prey is paralyzed, the grell floats up out of sight to devour it. The grell automatically hits paralyzed prey that is in its grasp without needing an attack roll. Captured prey lives for only a few rounds once paralyzed and whisked up out of sight.
    During combat rounds in which its victim is not paralyzed, it will use a minimum of two tentacles to flay whomever is in its grasp, and the remainder to flail at any other attackers. It can attack with its beak, but only against paralyzed creatures in its grasp. Remember that the grell is smart enough to make good decisions about how to allocate its ten tentacles for combat.
    Any hit on a tentacle will sever it, or at least render it unusable. The tentacles are AC 4, just like the body. However, damage done to the tentacles do not count against the creature's hit points. If left alone, the grell can regenerate lost tentacles in one to two days.
    The grell is immune to electrical attacks, such as lightning.
  Habitat/Society: |
    The grell chooses to live in underground realms or ruins. Its only known method of sight is by infravision, so it prefers areas of perpetual darkness. It is subject to the whims of strong air currents, so enclosed areas away from winds are sought.
    The grell is a solitary creature choosing to live apart from others of its kind. The only time it is found with other grell is when mating. It never bargains with other creatures willingly, but it is smart enough to cut a deal if the alternative is death. The grell has no interest in treasure or other trappings of humanoid civilization. Its den is usually a cave or ledge well above the floor. Frequently the grell sits just outside its den waiting for prey.
