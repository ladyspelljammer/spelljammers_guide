# Introduction
Imagine a universe where square worlds spin around gemstone suns. Where planets lie cradled in the roots of an oak tree so vast its leaves twirl around brightly burning suns. Where ships of wood sail the void between worlds and do battle with catapult and ballista, spell and sword, where an asteroid may be a safe harbor, a slaver's den, or a hungry creature eager to devour any that pass by. Where daring swashbucklers and scoundrels race for fantastic treasures and literally touch the stars. Where terrifying beasts with the power to destroy whole planets roam. Welcome . . . to Spelljammer!

In the Spelljammer campaign, the fantastic is possible and one is limited only by the depths of their imagination. Sailing ships, enwrapped in bubbles of air, travel empty Wildspace, moved by the power of their mystic Helms. Gravity is a matter of convenience, where a crew of adventurers can tour the bottom of their ship, and worlds come in all shapes and sizes. Whole solar systems are surrounded by colossal spheres made of an unbreakable, crystal-like substance to protect them from an ocean of swirling light and color, the flammable Phlogiston, which divides the void between stars.

## *A note from the Author*

Back in the early days of D&D, the Spelljammer setting was a way for players and DM's to travel between all of TSR's and WOTC's official settings without resorting to pesky things like *Teleportation* and *Plane Shifting*. C'mon, how cool is sailing a Spanish Galleon shaped like a fish through the stars from *The Forgotten Realms* to *Greyhawk* to *Dragonlance*?

Written for both players and Dungeon Masters, this document will serve as a fairly comprehensive adaptation and unofficial fan conversion of the original 1989 source documentation created by TSR Games (and purchased by Wizards of the Coast) for *Spelljammer*. I have tried very hard to keep to the original source documentation contained in *AD&D Adventures in Space*, *Concordance of Arcane Space*, *Lorebook of the Void*, *Encyclopedia Monstera*, *The Complete Starfarers Handbook*, and all other companion documents made for the Spelljammer setting. I've also tried to keep all pictures black and white, a la the original books. All art is Creative Commons or open source.

Additional consideration has been given to the words written by Wizards of the Coast on D&D 5th Edition design philosophy and the Three Pillars. I tried to make this fun, simple to pick up, and convenient to use in an extended campaign.

Lastly, rather than implementing the lore pertaining to the original Spelljammer setting, this document was simply designed as a rules conversion as far as I could take it. You can make up whatever lore you want, daisy-chaining in every piece of content 'til it bursts at the seams, and put these rules to work in your game. I would *highly* recommend purchasing the excellent *Monster Manual*, *Volo's Guide to Monsters*, and *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes* for societal research on the Gith, Beholders, Neogi, Illithid, and many other races found in the original *Spelljammer* books.

# Space

Wildspace is what comes to mind when we talk of "Space." It is the vast emptiness that lies between the planets and the stars. All the celestial bodies within a *Crystal Sphere* float in the airless void called Wildspace. Conventional (meaning "those that take place on the material plane") interplanetary journeys around a solar system take place within Wildspace. The regions of Wildspace are primarily airless vacuums, but the cosmos is large and vast with plenty of exceptions to the rules. Wildspace is not truly a void, although it is often referred to in that way. There is plenty to explore and conquer. Adventure is the only constant.

### Crystal Spheres

All Wildspace is bounded by a shell of impenetrable crystal, called a *Crystal Sphere* or *Crystal Shell*. Inside the crystal sphere is the airless vacuum of Wildspace and the planets where adventure takes place. Outside the crystal sphere is the rainbow river of Phlogiston and more Crystal Spheres. You can generally consider a Sphere to contain one solar system or cluster of planets, but that's a tremendous oversimplification.

The size of a Crystal Sphere is determined by the size of the planetary system inside. Usually a Crystal Sphere has a radius twice as big as the orbital radius of the outermost planetary body in the system (ie. the distance from the shell to the outermost planetary body of the system is the same as the distance from that outermost body to the center point of the system). Due to their great size, the outside of a Crystal Sphere appears perfectly flat when viewed up close. The curvature is so gradual that it is completely undetectable to anyone who is close enough to see the Crystal Sphere through the obscuring Phlogiston. The spheres consist of an unbreakable, murky, ceramic-like material of unknown origin.

Some legends state (and theologians agree) that the smooth-surfaced shells were created and positioned by the gods themselves to protect their worlds from the ravages of the Phlogiston, which is held to be the prime matter of the universe. Less charitable philosophers maintain that such shells were placed by an even higher authority to keep gods and men in and confine their activities. Whatever their origin, the Crystal Shells are uniform. All appear as great, dark, featureless spheres of unidentifiable matter.

The Crystal Spheres are defiantly solid. They have no gravity along either their interior or exterior sides (an exception to the rule that all large objects have gravity). No magic has been found that can damage or alter the surface of a shell, with the exception of those spells which cause portals to open. Even this is believed to be nothing more than an artificial triggering of a natural phenomenon, as naturally occurring portals appear seemingly at random. They are apparently immune to the effects of wishes and even the wills of the outer planar powers.

<br>

<div style="margin-top:250px;">

### The Phlogiston

Also called *The Flow*, the Phlogiston is a turbulent, unstable, multicolored, fluorescent gas-like medium which fills the regions between Crystal Spheres. For lack of a better definition, it is a river in which all Crystal Spheres bob, weave, and float. Its currents carry the spheres around a shifting stream, ever moving. Very little is known for certain about the Phlogiston, except for every system known is encased within a Crystal Sphere, and no known planetoids exist floating freely in the Phlogiston. Essentially, the Crystal Sphere keeps the Wildspace in and the Phlogiston out (which is a tremendous simplification, but it is easy to grasp). Phlogiston also cannot exist inside a Shell, and all attempts at doing so causes the somehow-captured Phologiston to have vanished upon inspection, leaving no traces. The rainbow ocean allows Spelljamming ships to attain greater velocities. These speeds have defied measurement since the phlogiston is without permanent landmarks or markers.

In general, it takes from 10-100 days to travel from one Crystal Sphere to another. The sphere reached is random, unless you have either a guide or a device installed in the ship to show you the way. Shortcuts exist through spheres to other spheres. Some spheres drift into and out of proximity with each other, so that just because you reach an area once does not mean that you will find it again.

It is also violently and exponentially flammable. An early researcher (wanting to have a better look at some of the ocean he captured) lit a match with the intent to burn a candle. Upon sparking, an explosion immediately erupted from the match head, taking most of the researchers hand. . . In short, a match acts as a powerful firework, a firework acts as a fireball, and the devastation that a fireball would cause may take even the largest ships (and the caster) with it.

### Space Travel

Space travel is hard to grasp by most groundlings. They look up at the skies and see a vast emptiness of infinite beauty.

Spelljamming ships can be made of anything: normal, sea-faring galleons; gargantuan, mutated bodies of Beholders; ships grown in a vast forest-turned-dry-dock; bones of long-dead dragons; contraptions made from junkyards and bound together by rubber-bands; the splinters and masts of defeated ships; or even the very mountains themselves. What makes them a Spelljamming ship is the *Spelljamming Helm*, whether permanently bolted down, or temporarily there.

### On Spelljamming Helms

Ships travel through Wildspace by means of the *Spelljamming Helm* - a magical device which converts mystical energy into motive force; ie. the "push" that moves a Spelljamming ship. This allows rapid movement from planet to planet. Some of the specifics vary from race-to-race, and ship-to-ship; While the helm provides the push forward, the crew provides the maneuvering, stopping, and docking.

A Helm can be made to look like almost anything: A lofty perch made of hard oak, with pillows in the seat and back, and topped with gold filigree; a sleek, futuristic chair made of obsidian and lined with purple silks; a large leaf, elegantly grown into position and automatically shaping to fit it's user; a meditation bench, as simplistic in style as it is in make; or a large uncomfortable iron throne constructed from the swords of a defeated army. How a Helm looks will speak volumes about both its creator, as well as its user. All will function the same and provide the necessary focus point to move about space. Generally, it's installed onto the Bridge of a ship, away from prying eyes and (more importantly) attacks.

There are many sorts of basic Spelljammer Helms: Minor and Major. All Helms require the user’s Concentration to function, as if the user were concentrating on a spell. Due to the Concentration required, no more than eight hours can be spent at a time using this device by one caster. Attempts to "push through" may cause one point of exhaustion (as per the rules for a forced march in chapter 8 of the *Player's Handbook*).

```
```

Other sorts of rare or advanced Helms include:
- *Lifejammers* - These helms suck the very life from the user to power a vessel and perform special maneuvers.
- *Orbus* - Mutated and specially grown Beholder-kin, used by the various Beholder races to provide movement to their otherworldly vessels.
- *Artiforge* - This device is installed in a ships core and provides the force necessary for movement throughout space without a helmsman. This does require a forgemaster and a portion of the crew forging to ensure proper upkeep and use of the forge itself. As this doubles as a blacksmiths forge for creating weapons and armor, a certain output of those forge-created items is needed in order to keep the fire burning and the ship moving forward.
- *Sequence Helms* - This helm type allows for multiple characters to contribute to the overall Speed of a vessel, but halves a single user's contribution to the overall Ship speed. *Helm Rating* - detailed on the next page - is calculated normally, then halved, rounded down. The number of Sequence helms able to contribute to the ship speed on a single vessel is unlimited.
- Rare and otherwise legendary Helms allow full casting while simultaneously piloting the ship, remote control of a ship, full movement about the vessel, and much more!

Any character may use a helm, though only one character may use a single helm at a time. Attunement to the helm requires a short rest to ensure that the adventurer understands how to concentrate properly and convert their innate magical energy into ship movement. It takes one action to activate, and one action to deactivate the Helm. Characters with the Spellcasting, Ki, and Pact Magic class features can use additional abilities of the helm, listed later in this document.

Exhausted characters attempting to use a Helm reduce the total Speed of the ship by the number of exhaustion points they have attained. After 48 continuous hours on the Helm, regardless of the ship's current Speed or the number of exhaustion points gained, the individual using the Helm will pass out and be unable to use the Helm again until they complete a Long Rest.

While using the Helm to power a ship the helmsman is unable to cast a spell that requires concentration, and is considered restrained. The individual seated upon the Helm can talk and act normally, but cannot leave the Helm while the ship is in motion.

While piloting, the Helmsman can observe her surroundings normally, but also gains an awareness of the space around the ship. As an action, you can see from any point in or on the ship until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

### Determining Helm Rating

Use the table below to determine your Helm Rating to spellcaster level ratio when determining the ships overall Speed when using a helm to pilot a ship. A Minor Helm grants a 1:3 ratio of Helm Rating to spellcaster level, and a Major Helm grants a 1:2 ratio of Helm Rating to spellcaster level. This is similar to determining your spell slots when multiclassing, but all classes are able to provide motive force when using a helm to pilot a ship (*Players handbook p.163-164*)

Add together all your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorceror, Warlock, and Wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the Paladin, Monk, Ranger, Mystic, and Artificer classes, and a third of the levels taken in Fighter or Rogue classes (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster archetype. Characters with levels in classes that do not grant the Spellcasting, Pact Magic, Psionics, or Ki abilities divide by four (rounded down, a minimum of 1) to determine Helm Rating.

**Example 1:** A 10th level wizard using a Minor Helm will have a spellcaster level of 10, and that same character grants a Helm Rating of 3 to the overall ship speed.

**Example 2:** A character that has multiclassed a 5th-level bard and a 3rd-level barbarian will have a spellcaster level of 6, and that same character using a Major Helm will grant a Helm Rating of 3 to the overall Speed.

**Example 3:** A character that has multiclassed a 6th level warlock and an 8th level paladin will have a spellcaster level of 10, and that same character using a Major Helm will grant a Helm Rating of 5 to the overall Speed.

## Ship Terminology
<br>

**Armor Class (AC)**- Difficulty of hitting a ship and dealing damage to the ship when striking it.

**Beam Length**- This is the measurement of the widest part of the ship from port to starboard (left to right). Important when dealing with gravity and the air pocket that surrounds a ship.

**Crew Min/Max**- These two numbers indicate the minimum number of crew required to operate the ship and maximum occupancy of the ship before air reduction becomes an issue.

**Damage Threshold (DT)**- An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than it’s DT, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object’s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn’t reduce the object’s hull points. All Ships and Siege Weapons are immune to Poison and Psychic damage.

**Helm Type**- This indicates what type of Spelljammer Helm can be used to run the ship. Most ships can be run off either a Major or Minor Helm, but others may require a special type of Helm not listed here.

**Hull Points (HP)**- Hull points for ships are identical to Hit Points for characters and monsters. They measure the amount of damage the ship can sustain before it is destroyed.

**Keel Length**- This is the length of the ship from fore to aft (front to back). Important when dealing with gravity and the air pocket that surrounds a ship.

**Maneuverability Rating (MR)**- Your ships ability to turn, accelerate, and maneuver with the ship alone. Takes into account sails, rigging, size, weight, and other aerodynamic capacities.

**Standard Armaments**- This is the amount and type of weaponry that can be installed on a ship. Ship weapons range from medium-size weapons such as Light ballista to Large-size weapons such as a trebuchet.

**Tonnage**- This is a measure of the physical displacement that a spelljamming ship takes up. For each ton, you can consider the ship taking up 300 cubic feet of space. This displacement influences the amount of breathable air surrounding a ship in wildspace, and 300 cubic feet of space allows one medium sized creature to comfortably breathe for four months. Lastly, tonnage is used in determining the dimensions of the ship itself, crew size, and cargo limit. This is not a measure of the ships weight. The actual dimensions of the ship are unimportant.

**Type/Name**- This is the name or type of your Spelljammer ship.

## Siege Weaponry

A siege weapon is a device that is designed to break or circumvent city or castle walls and other fortifications. Most groundling-based siege weapons are immobile, constructed in place to attack enemy fortifications from a distance, while others are wheeled to enable advancing up to the enemy fortification. That being said, siege weaponry have been adopted to Space Warfare with fervor. All Siege weapons mounted on Spelljamming ships are on 360° rotating turrets, and may fire in any direction regardless of the facing of a ship. Before it can be fired, all siege weapons must be loaded and aimed. A Load, Aim, and Fire action are done using one Ship Action taken by the Gunner.

For Siege Weaponry statistics, please see the [Seige Weapons table, Page 22](#p22)

**Ballista**- A Ballista is a massive crossbow that fires heavy bolts. Before it can be fired, it must be loaded and aimed. A Load, Aim, and Fire action are done using one Ship Action taken by the Gunner.

In atmosphere near a planetoid, the Light Ballista has a 120/480 ft range, and a Heavy Ballista has a 240/960 ft range.

**Gnomish Sweeper**- A Gnomish Sweeper is a pair of light ballistas with a shared, common mount so that they can be fired in the same direction at the same time. The two blunt bolts from these ballistas are linked with a heavy chain (similar in image to nunchaku). The intention of the chain is to be used as an antipersonnel weapon against enemy crews.

A Gnomish Sweeper affects all targets in a 10-foot square. It will continue on into the next 10 foot square away from the ship firing it unless it meets with a large, unmovable object, which cause the Sweeper Bolts to drop to the deck. In addition, every target within the 10-foot square is forced to make a Reflex save (DC 13). On failure, the targets fall prone and gain the grappled condition. The Gnomish Sweeper does not inflict hull damage with the Sweeper Rounds, but can be used as a dual Light Ballista in a crunch, with the same requirements for crew as two Light Ballistas (the weapon does not fire unless both bolts are loaded).

In atmosphere near a planetoid, the Gnomish Sweeper has a 300/1,200 ft range.

**Trebuchet**- A Trebuchet is a powerful catapult that throws its payload in a high arc. A trebuchet typically hurls a heavy stone. However, it can launch other kinds of projectiles, such as barrels of oil or sewage, with different effects.

In atmosphere near a planetoid, the Light Trebuchet has a 300/1,200 ft range, and the Heavy Trebuchet has a 500/1,500 ft range.

**Cannon**- a Cannon uses gunpowder to propel heavy balls of cast iron through the air at destructive speeds. In a campaign without gunpowder, a cannon might be an arcane device built by clever gnomes or wizardly engineers. A cannon is usually supported in a wooden frame with wheels, but on a Spelljamming ship, it is mounted the same as every other siege weapon, on a 360° rotating turret.

In atmosphere near a planetoid, the Light Cannon has a 600/2,400 ft range, and the Heavy Cannon has a 1,200/4,800 ft range.

**Alchemist's Fire Projector**- This device shoots a thin stream of flaming, explosive liquid. Though it can be devastating in combat, the Alchemist's Fire Projectors are not popular with ships that cross between the spheres because of the flammability of the Flow. In fact, Alchemist's Fire projectors are recipes for disaster in the Phlogiston. They are popular, however among crews that do not leave their spheres.

In atmosphere near a planetoid, the Alchemist's Fire Projector has a 150/600 ft range.

```
```

*Alchemist's Fire*- While some adventuring parties know this substance as a throw-able flask of sticky, adhesive fluid, aboard a Spelljamming ship it is generally stored in stone casks for use in Alchemist's Fire Projectors and as alternate ammunition in catapults. Alchemist's Fire ignites when exposed to air. When a cask is catapulted onto an enemy deck, the stone jug breaks and immediately explodes, dealing 3d10 fire damage in a 15-foot radius sphere. Any creatures in the sphere may make a DC 14 Dex saving throw. On a success, target suffers half damage. On a failure, creatures and any other objects in the sphere are now on fire. Also may ignite other jugs in burst radius.

**Ram**- Mounted to the front of ships, a Ram consists of nothing more than a heavy log, shod in iron. There are several different types that can be mounted to the front of Spelljamming ships. A ship can only have one type of Ram installed at a time.

- *Piercing*- A piercing ram is a long, sharp prow used to break apart and pierce an enemy ship.
- *Blunt*- This is a flattened prow designed to inflict internal damage by shaking up the smaller ship.
- *Grappling*- The grappling ram incorporates one or more movable arms which attach themselves to an opponent's ship with suction cups or hooks after ramming, locking the ships together. This type of ram is very useful during boarding situations.

# The Crew
A good crew is the lifesblood of a sailing vessel. A ship cannot sail without a crew, and a crew cannot sail without a ship. They are interlinked, cosmically. The best crews will make voyages pleasent for you and terrible for your enemies. A Spelljamming ship sailing without a crew will will fly at half Speed, as the needed functions of turning the sails, operating the oars, or maintaining the ship itself will have to be done by the party members. All spelljamming ships have two crew numbers as listed in the chart on Spelljamming Ships and Equipment- The minimum needed to run the ship, and the max that the craft can hold without overloading it’s atmosphere. Crews are divided into three classifications: **Green**, **Trained**, and **Crack**. Standard costs per crew member per month are below:

- Green: 2 gp per standard month
- Trained: 4 gp per standard month
- Crack: 6 gp per standard month

Additionally, crews going into hazardous situations normally demand an extra share of plunder to be divided among the crew.

- **Green sailors** can be picked up everywhere. They are warm bodies to fill the ranks, clean the decks, and turn the sails.
- **Trained sailors** are veterans of many voyages, often on a number of ships. They are numerous, but that does not mean they are easy to find. Generally only about 3d10 trained sailors can be found for hire in any given larger city, and 1d10 smaller cities.
- **Crack sailors** are not so much rare as very specialized. They are the best at what they do for a particular First Mate and aboard a particular ship, almost psychically linked to the needs of the situation. Transplanting a Crack crew to a new ship reduces it to Trained status, as well as changing the First Mate to a new party member.

A Green crew attains Trained status after two months of travel (for example, two days of travel, a week hanging around a dock, and two more days of travel only add up to four days), including at least one trip to the Phlogiston.

A Trained crew gains proficiency with Spelljamming vehicles, grants advantage to any Persuasion or Intimidation checks made onboard the ship by any party member, and they may move to any part of the party's ship within one ship combat round. A Trained crew attains Crack status after two more months, including another trip to the Phlogiston, a battle with another ship or space creature of ship size or larger, and service under the same First Mate.

A Crack crew grants the proficiency bonus of the First Mate to ship initiative during Tactical combat and to ship Speed, as well as to attacks with all weapons attached to the party’s ship.

Crew members may be lost through travel in space. As long as at least 51% of the total crew stay alive between recruitment missions, crew status doesn’t change. In the case of a tie, the lower crew status applies. For example: A crew comprised of 50% Green, 40% Trained, and 10% Crack will be a Green crew overall.

Optional loyalty rules can be applied as listed in the *Dungeon Masters Guide* page 93. Generally, unless the ship they are on is about to be destroyed, no crew member will stray far from the safety of the ship, even when moored at the most hospitable dock.

Some crew members may stick around through thick and thin and develop personalities and traits of their own. Feel free to give backgrounds (as listed in the *Player Handbook*), voices, and personalities to your crew to liven up your game.

Basic Crew Statistics are listed below. You may find special crew members throughout Wildspace and beyond that may differ from the statistics listed here. There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs:

**Racial Traits**

You may add racial traits to a crew member. For example, a halfling crew might have a speed of 25 feet and the *Lucky* trait. Adding racial traits to any NPC doesn’t alter its challenge rating.

**Armor and Weapon Swaps**

You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s armor and weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage may change an NPC’s challenge rating.

# Roles on the Ship

Who does what aboard a sailing vessel, and when? What kind of jobs are available aboard beyond the able-bodied sailor? This chapter will give a brief look into the roles on a Spelljamming vessel. It is advised to establish a Station for everyone aboard the ship to keep the troops in line and the decks swabbed. In case of trouble, everyone knows their job and what to do.

### Stations
On a Spelljamming ship, various stations exist that can be filled by a player at your table. The magic of the helm allows all  characters to perform arcane wonders. One player character is assigned per ship role. If there aren't enough ship roles, the remaining party members should act as "seconds" to the existing ship roles. Ship roles cannot be changed during combat and NPC's may not fill ship roles.

#### Cook
The proud cook is a position of distinction aboard all Spelljamming vessels due to the long term benefits that healthy, magical meals provide. They can also whip something up in short order for those that are hungry *now*.

#### Engineer
The Engineer takes care of the repair and fitting out of the vessel, and examines whether it is sufficiently provided with ropes, pulleys, sails, and all the other rigging that is necessary for a voyage. When fires erupt on-board or a siege weapon is , the Engineer is the one to call.

#### First Mate
The force of personality necessary to hold together an unruly bunch of scallywags, the First Mate handles the crew in the best of times and the worst of times. A First Mate's duties include overseeing the health and wellness of the crew, envoys, cargo, and passengers. This role is generally the face of the party.

#### Gunner
The Gunner is in charge of maintaining and firing the weapons systems aboard a Spelljamming ship. This includes ensuring that all weapons are kept in good repair. A knowledgeable Gunner is essential to the crew's effective use of the offensive means of protection aboard a spelljamming vessel. On a ship without siege weapons, a gunner isn't needed.

```
```

<div style="margin-top:150px;"></div>
<br>
#### Helmsman
The Helmsman is in charge of navigating the ship through spaces unknown. This station is appointed to, more often than not, the most able-bodied mage aboard a Spelljamming ship. Generally sits below-deck. This role is required to be filled for the ship to move throughout wildspace and beyond.

#### Magic Officer
Last, but certainly not least, the Magic Officer directs the course and looks after the maps and instruments necessary for navigation, and sends messages to other ships and docks. It's not required to know any magic to be a Magic Officer, and this role is often given the person with the best sense of direction and tracking ability.<br><br>

> Please have a seat right here for a moment, brave adventurer; We have to talk. You may have noticed that there is no *Captain* role aboard a Spelljamming vessel.<br><br>
>
>The idea for *Ship Roles* are to be the direct opposite of a "Chain-of-Command". This is to provide ease of docking and bureaucracy for the various folk you meet in starfaring kingdoms for RP purposes. This is so that players and NPC's played by the DM have those points to move the story forward at a reasonable pace.<br><br>
>
>All members of the adventuring party should get an equal vote in matters. The idea here is to keep player agency for *The Party's Ship*, and not *The Captain's Ship*.<br><br>
>
>We are all equal at this round table.<br><br>
>
>That being said, if you and the members of your group are calm, rational, fun, open, and controlled adults, and understand you're all playing a game, you can replace the "First Mate" ship role with the "Captain" ship role, which has the same abilities.

# Movement in Space

Every ship in motion has a Speed, which is the distance that the ship can move in a given period of time. On a hex space (hexagonal spaced) grid, each ship takes up one hex space, which refers not to the size of the ship itself, but the size of the sky it controls. Hex spaces do not take up a specific distance, but are rather more about the story being told in the theatre of the mind.

Your ship Speed is determined by the MR of the ship itself and your Helm Rating, using the formula below:

**Speed = Helm Rating + MR of Ship**

In Combat and other tactical scenarios, the speed of the ship is the number of hex spaces it can move per round and/or the number of hex facings it can change.

Out of Combat and other tactical scenarios, A Spelljamming ship is outstandingly fast; even a mountain transplanted from a celestial body (with a Spelljamming Helm installed) will travel 100,000,000 miles per day (about 4 million miles per hour) in Wildspace regardless of ship Speed. 100 million miles per 24 hour day sounds like a lot (it’s approx. the distance from the Earth to the Sun) but Wildspace is unbelievably large and that same ship would take 36 days to reach Pluto from the Earth. A Crystal Shell is as far from the orbit of the furthest planetary body as it is to the primary star. The Crystal Shell housing Earth’s planetary system would take 72 days to reach from the center, and vice versa.

What slows movement among more crowded inner planets is the presence of multiple, occasionally overlapping, *Gravity Wells*. When a ship moves to the Gravity Well of a large body (10 tons or greater), or when Tactical Combat is detected automatically by the Helm, it immediately drops to tactical speed of one hex per Speed per round until it has left the planets Gravity Well, or combat is concluded.  A ship caught this way can descend to the surface, move around in the atmosphere, leave the area, or proceed with combat. Aside from the most basic awareness change, the “sudden stop” does not affect anyone on the ship, and the safety appears to be built in to the magic of the Helm itself.

On average in the gravity well of a planetoid, this translates into about 10 miles per hour or about 240 miles per day.

```
```

<div style='margin-top:80px'></div>

Tactical scenarios near a large body move this way due to the close interaction with a planetoids atmosphere, gravity well, and weather conditions.

Ships move on a hex grid, and movement is determined by Speed. Optionally, you may have ships move on a square grid (with 8 facings (ie. the corners and sides of a square), but these rules are designed for hex-based combat. If using a square grid, you may add 1 to the overall Speed of all ships to account for the extra facings that need to be made.

The Speed of your ship is the number of facings that the ship can change and/or hex spaces it is able to move per round of combat. Facing a different direction in the hex space you're in, or moving one hex space forward uses one Speed. You deduct one Speed to turn the ship towards a different hex side adjacent to the port or starboard (left or right) of the current bow (front) position of the ship. You may also spend one Speed to move forward into the hex space adjacent to the current hex space where your ship resides and faces.

For example:
*The Monarch*, a Tradesman ship, has a Speed of 8. The Helmsman piloting *The Monarch* wishes to move away from an oncoming ramming attack directly from the bow (front) by an enemy Mindspider vessel. The Helmsman spends two Speed to turn the ship to the starboard-side (right) two facings of the hex that it currently resides in. The Helmsman then urges the ship forward four hex spaces in the direction that the ship is now facing, spending four Speed, for a total of six spent this round. A single Speed is then spent to turn port-ways (left) one hex facing (seven total), and the ship uses its' last Speed for the turn with a move forward one hex around a floating piece of space junk, readying for the next round. The helmsman has spent all her Speed for the round.

Any ship without a Helmsman, a broken vessel, or any errant detritus floating about in the area moves at a constant speed in one direction across the battlefield using it's last known speed. Be wary, as brigands and other ne'er-do-wells may be hiding just beyond a floating rock, lying in wait to attack. . .

### Time in Space
In general, time between two planetary bodies can be figured as:

- Time for take off (in rounds) +
- Time to escape gravity well (in rounds) +
- Time to cover distance to next planet (rounds, minutes, days, weeks, or months, as appropriate) +
- Time to land (in rounds)

#### Travel Time
Travel time between the various planetary bodies is taken into consideration, as there is only so much air that the ship can bring with it. For ease of relaying travel information, planetary motion isn't a major factor determining travel times and positions of each planet. Listed below is an example for average travel time from Earth to the various other planetary bodies in our solar system:

Planet| Mercury | Venus | Mars | Jupiter | Saturn | Uranus | Neptune |
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
Earth| 13h | 6h | 12h | 3.9d | 8.0d | 16.9d | 27.0d |

For more information on how a universe is laid out and created, as well as optional rules, see the chapter on *[Celestial Mechanics](#p28)*.

#### Takeoff & Landing

When taking off from a planetary body, a certain amount of time is required to allow the Helm to overcome the force of normal gravity and fully leave the planets’ gravity well. The amount of time it takes to leave the planets’ Gravity Well are listed below:

- Size A, B, & C – Ten minutes
- Size D, E, & F – Twenty minutes

Once a planets Gravity Well has been left, full movement at Spelljamming speed can begin. Temporary ships (Those that have been cobbled together from broken vessels), cannot make a takeoff or landing safely and will Crash, completely destroying the vessel.

> Optionally, you may refer to the weather rules in the *Dungeon Masters Guide*, pages 109-111 and 117-119.
> - In *None* and *Light* wind conditions, Normal takeoff and Land times occur.
> - In *Strong Wind*, *Light Rain*, or *Light Snow*, takeoff and land times are 2x normal time.
> - In *Heavy Wind*, *Heavy Rain*, or *Heavy Snow*, takeoff and land times are 4x normal time.
> - In *Hurricane* winds, no safe takeoff or landing is possible. If forced, roll 1d10. On a 1 or 2, ship crashes and must be repaired before travel can resume.

# Ship Combat

There are times when diplomacy comes to an end, and conflict begins. Most groundlings fight hand-to-hand with sword, shield, and magic; horse, army, and castle. This is not so in the depths of space, as there's no field in the field-of-battle, just airless void and the ships you see before you. Siege weaponry has adapted quite well to the depths of space, and is used quite effectively.

At the beginning of combat, you roll initiative for each ship rather than each party member. Ship initiative is modified by the initiative of the character at the Helm, and any addition that the crew provides. If combat becomes hand-to-hand, roll for character initiative normally. A combat round lasts 1 minute (60 seconds) in ship-to-ship tactical combat. Hand-to-hand combat rounds last 6 seconds.

Some victors of extraplantary combat will sift through the debris of broken ships for prisoners, slaves, and loot, while others will abandon them. It’s possible for survivors to lash up some of the vessel to create a Temporary ship to save themselves with a Helm and air pocket, but they must act quickly!

## Critical Hits
Crewed siege weapons often have a chance of inflicting a Critical Hit to enemy vessels on a roll of 20. Other events (Ramming, Spells, Crashing, turbulence from terrestrial or solar winds, etc) may also cause a Critical Hit. When a vessel is reduced to 50% of its Hull Points, it suffers a Critical Hit. When you score a critical hit, instead of doubling the damage dice, you will roll on the following table:

##### Critical Hit Table
**d10 Roll**|**Effect**
:-----:|:-----:
1|Fire!
2|Ship Shaken!
3|Hull Holed!
4|Speed Loss!
5|Random Ship Weapon Damaged
6|Deck crew Damage!
7|Interior crew Damage!
8|Speed Loss!
9|Fire!
10|Spelljammer Shock!

**Fire!**- A fire starts somewhere in or on the ship, determined by the DM. If a fire is unable to start (all lights are magical, there is hull is made of stone, no sails, etc) then roll again. Fire may damage the sails, burn passengers and cargo, and cause chaos amongst the crew. Fires aboard a ship deal 1d6 Hull Points of fire damage per ship combat round. This damage isn't negated by the Damage Threshold.

```
```

<div style="margin-top:290px;"></div>
<br>

**Hull Holed**- The attack punches a sizable hole in the ship. DM decides location. If three total holes are scored on any vessel of 50 tonnes or less, it's internal structure is destroyed and the vessel starts to break apart. For vessels larger than 50 tonnes, the number of holes needed to break apart a vessel is 1 per 15 tonnes of the ship, rounded down.

**Ship Shaken**- All PC’s not otherwise secured (Helmsman is considered secured) must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Deck crew Damage**- One creature on deck is struck and suffers either the same damage as the ship or 2d10, whichever is lower. Choose the target randomly from all above-deck. All creatures within 5ft (generally members of the same group) must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or suffer the same damage.

**Interior crew Damage**- Same as a *Deck crew Damage* Critial Hit, but everyone not on deck is a potential target, including Helmsman, passengers, and prisoners. This reflects not so much the attack itself, but shattered parts of the ship bouncing around during combat.

**Ship weapon damaged**- One ship weapon (chosen randomly) is damaged and inoperable until repaired. Duration of repair is 1d4 rounds. Any crew on the weapon is unharmed. If no weapons exist on-board the ship, roll again.

**Speed Loss**- Ship Speed is lowered by 1d8 for 1d4 rounds (min 1). If a ship is already at Speed 1, then roll again.

**Spelljammer Shock**- The spelljamming Helmsman must make a Concentration Check (PHB p.203). If no personal or ship damage was dealt to bring about a Critical Hit roll, then the DC is 12. If the Helmsman fails this check, they lose concentration and are unable to pilot the ship for 1d4 rounds, after which they are free to begin piloting again. In the case of multiple Helmsman, they all must make the save. In the case of Foundries, Artifurnaces, or other drives not using a Helmsman, the drive itself is rendered nonfunctional for 1d4 days while being repaired. If no replacement is available, the ship immediately becomes Speed 0 and can only move in a straight line at it’s present speed.

### Ship Actions
During your ships turn, each character may perform one *Ship Action* pertaining to their role on the ship. After Ship Actions are resolved, each character may take one normal round of combat actions. If a character is not assigned a ship role, they may only take one normal round of combat actions. You may use your ship action and/or normal round of combat actions to cast spells, perform attacks, dance, talk, or any number of other actions that could normally take place in combat.

Ship Actions are declared at the beginning of the combat round, before individual combat actions, and take place simultaneously - If a ship doesn't have enough members to crew the siege weapons and repair damage, while also repelling invaders, then priorities will have to be decided. Many ship actions are listed below for each station on a ship, but this is not an exhaustive list.

The rule is that if a player can perform the action and explain how their described Ship Action would help the ship, crew, or situation in any way, and would reasonably take under one minute, it can be considered their Ship Action for the turn. Players are encouraged to come up with new and unique solutionss. DM's are encouraged to say "yes, and".

A ship combat round, with each character performing a ship action and a normal round of combat actions, lasts for one minute. If a player wishes to cast a spell with a one minute casting time, then no Ship Action can be used that round for that character, as they are busy casting a spell.

Several Ship Actions reference and target a group of crew members. This group includes a number of crew members and the ship role overseeing that group. For example, if three crew members are needed to operate a siege weapon, and an incoming attack scores a Deck Crew Damage critical hit, then the group targeted in this way would be those three crew members at that siege weapon and the party member assigned to the Gunner ship role.

Ship Actions and who may use them are including, but not limited to:

#### ***The First Mate***
may order crew to specific spots on the ship to attack or defend in hand-to-hand combat, or to avoid incoming attacks. This role also generally performs Medicine checks to diagnose wounds or diseases, create healing potions using an Herbalism Kit, administer healing potions to one group of crew members (such as the crew assigned to one siege weapon, or the crew assigned to repairing damage to the ship), or cast healing spells. Instead of ordering crew to specific stations, the First Mate may *Mass Stabilize* or *Lend a Hand*.

- *Mass Stabilize*<br> When this action is performed by the First Mate during the Ship Action phase, you may stabilize any number of creatures on board that have been brought to zero hit points and with the unconscious condition as a result of damage. Those creatures stabilized in this way lose the unconscious condition, are at 1 HP, and are prone.

- *Lend a Hand*<br>
The First Mate jumps into action helping out where they can to bolster a specific group of crew members assigned by one ship station (such as the crew assigned to one siege weapon, or the crew assigned to repairing damage in a specific area of the ship).

This functions as follows for each ship station, and the crew assigned to various tasks throughout the ship:

  * <u>Cook</u> - The Cook may administer meals to two groups instead of one with the *Short Order* ship action. This action must be used during both the preparation and the serving.
  * <u>Magic Officer</u> - The Magic Officer obtains two pieces of information with the *Spyglass* ship action. Instead of obtaining extra information, the Magic Officer may roll with advantage on Charisma checks with the *Hail!* ship action.
  * <u>Helmsman</u> - The Helmsman may reduce the cost of maneuvers by one spell slot, one Ki point, or 1d8 Psychic damage, minimum one spell slot, one Ki point, or 1d8 Psychic damage.
  * <u>Gunner</u> - The Gunner may roll with advantage on the next siege weapon attack roll.
  * <u>Engineer</u> - The Engineer reduces number of Hull Holed critical hits by two instead of one. Instead of reducing number of Hull Holed critical hits, the Engineer may reduce the time to *Douse Flames!* on the vessel by one ship combat turn, minimum one turn.

<div style='margin-top:195px'></div>

#### ***The Cook***
provides both long- and short-term benefits through the use of magical ingredients and special preparation. With a cook on-board, all foodstuffs aboard a Spelljamming vessel last twice as long. The ingredients themselves are found at space ports and harvested far and wide. The Cook can provide quick benefits during a heated battle using the *Short Order* ship action. Long-term benefits can be granted by the Cook through the *Daily Special* ship action.

- *Short Order*<br>
The *Cook* whips up a quick, magical meal that can provide a limited benefit to a group of crew members assigned to a task (such as the crew assigned to turning the sails, or the crew assigned to repairing damage to the ship). It takes one Ship Action to prepare the meal and one Ship Action to serve the meal to a group of crew members. A group of crew members can only be under the effects of one Short Order at a time.

  * <u>Fortunate Cookies</u>: A wafery snack with an philosophic quip wrapped inside. Until the end of their next ship combat turn, any crew that eats the Fortunate Cookies may roll a d6 and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Fortunate Cookie die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Fortunate Cookie die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Fortunate Cookie die at a time.

  * <u>Hearty Noodles</u>: A hot cup of wiggly noodles with rejuvenating broth. Until the next long rest, any group of crew members that consumes a cup of Hearty Noodles gains an additional 1d10 + Character level temporary hit points.

- *Daily Special*<br>
The Cooks training can provide lengthy benefits that can help your adventuring party. More ingredients than listed here may be found throughout wildspace, and their effects may vary. To gain the benefit of the Daily Special, the crew must eat at least one meal per day prepared on a ship with an active helmsman and with the special ingredients. This must occur for two weeks before effects begin, and the effects last for two weeks from the time the last meal was consumed.

```
```

<div style='margin-top:213px'></div>
<br>

  * <u>Chillgreen Leaf</u>: Found at the bottom of the deepest rivers in the 'verse; when this briny, green, perfumed leaf is sun-dried and included with your crews' meals, characters are able to hold their breath for twice as long. Additionally, a character that becomes unconscious in a body of water while under the effects of this ingredient floats to the nearest source of air at a moderate pace, and is positioned to face the air when the unconscious character reaches it. This is generally the surface of a body of water, but this may be different under other circumstances.

  * <u>Obsidian Salt</u>: An onyx colored, salt-like substance that increases the vibrance of all food. When this ingredient is included with meals, characters are able to withstand environments of either extreme hot or extreme cold much easier and roll with advantage on exhaustion checks in those environments. At the time of cooking, the Cook chooses either an environment of extreme hot or extreme cold, but not both.

#### ***The Gunner***
may order crew to the siege weapons systems onboard to fire at enemy vessel(s). The Gunner may *Fire Ship Weapons*, *Fire at Will*, or *Grapple*.

- *Load. . . Aim. . . Fire!*<br>
A normal siege weapon attack includes loading and aiming the weapon. All siege weapons are mounted on rotating turrets.

- *Fire at Will!*<br>
The Gunner commands the crew to fire all siege weapons on-board at all enemy vessels (maximum of three targets). One attack is made at disadvantage per siege weapon, per target.

- *Grapple*<br> This ship action is used in conjunction with the helmsman. This is a contested roll used with grappling hooks manned by the crew or the grappling ram; Both ships participating in the grapple are required to roll 1d20 + Ship Speed. Degrappling is automatic if both vessels desire it, otherwise it’s resolved as a contested grappling roll. See *Grappling* on page 195 of the *Players Handbook*. Can only be used when targets are within one adjacent hex.

\page

#### ***The Helmsman***
may move the vessel up to the ships Speed. Additionally, the Helmsman may initiate one *Stunt*.

- *Stunt*<br>
In addition to ordinary movement, a Helmsman can attempt *Stunts* with her ship. Several stunts affect your starship’s Armor Class (AC), siege weapon attacks, and movement abilities. Listed below are several stunts that can be performed by all Helmsman, using properties of the helm.

  - *Ramming*<br>
If the ship is equipped with a Ram, the Helmsman may *Ram* another ship. When ramming, the attack modifier used is that of the Helmsman’s spell attack bonus. If the helmsman does not have a spell attack bonus, then the modifier is +1. If a hit is scored, damage is equal to the damage of the ram. Ships without a ram installed, or ships which attempt to Ram vessels more than twice their size in tonnage *Crash* instead. The ship must move in a straight line for at least three consecutive hex spaces to perform a Ramming Ship Action.

  - *Shearing*<br>
The Helmsman may *Shear* another ship. Ships equipped with rams may attempt to shear away the rigging of the opposing vessels. This is treated as a ram attack, except no damage is done to the opposing ship. Instead, for each successful shear attack, rigging, ships weapons, and even crew can be targeted. The ship must move in a straight line at least three consecutive hex spaces to perform a Shearing Ship Action. A successful *Shearing* attack causes the "Speed Loss" Critical Hit.

  - *Crash*<br>
A truly desperate move, a Helmsman may intentionally crash her ship into the opposing vessel, creature, or planetary body. To crash into another ship intentionally, treat this attack as a *Ramming* action. On a hit, deal 5d10 damage to all ships involved in the Crash. This damage is not reduced by the Damage Threshold. A successful Crash will cause the *Spelljammer Shock* to all helmsman, and two *Hull Holed* Critical Hits to all ships involved in the crash. Roll 1d10. On a roll of 1, any Alchemist Fire casks on-board any ship involved in the crash explode, dealing damage to the ship they were on.

```
```

  - *Tactical Regroup*<br>
    * <u>Major or Minor Helm</u> - Expend One Level 1 (or higher) Spell Slot or One Ki<br>
    * <u>Lifejammer</u> - Deal 1d8 Psychic damage to all Helmsman

The ship moves up to half its speed in the direction of the aft (rear) edge without changing hex facing. This doesn't count toward ship movement.

  - *Barrel Roll*<br>
    * <u>Major or Minor Helm</u> - Expend One Level 2 (or higher) Spell Slot or One Ki<br>
    * <u>Lifejammer</u> - Deal 2d8 Psychic damage to all Helmsman

The vessel moves up to half its Speed forward without changing hex facing and flips along its central axis (if there were directions such as up and down in space, the ship would spin upsidown from its initial position). Until your next turn, siege weapon attacks against your ship are at disadvantage.

  - *Turn in Place*<br>
    * <u>Major or Minor Helm</u> - Expend One Level 2 (or higher) Spell Slot or Two Ki<br>
    * <u>Lifejammer</u> - Deal 2d8 Psychic damage to all Helmsman

The ship does not move forward but instead can turn to face any direction. This doesn't count toward ship movement.

  - *Hard Turn*<br>
    * <u>Major or Minor Helm</u> - Expend Two Level 2 (or higher) Spell Slots or Two Ki<br>
    * <u>Lifejammer</u> - Deal 2d8 Psychic damage to all Helmsman

The ship moves forward up to half its Speed and rotates 180 degrees to face the aft hex side at the end of the movement. This doesn't count toward ship movement.

  - *Catch the Wind*<br>
    * <u>Major or Minor Helm</u> - Expend Two Level 3 (or higher) Spell Slots or Three Ki<br>
    * <u>Lifejammer</u> - Deal 3d8 Psychic damage to all Helmsman

The ship moves forward one and a half times it's total Speed without changing hex facing. This doesn't count toward ship movement.

  - *Flyby*<br>
    * <u>Major or Minor Helm</u> - Expend Two Level 3 (or higher) Spell Slots or Three Ki<br>
    * <u>Lifejammer</u> - Deal 3d8 Psychic damage to all Helmsman

The ship moves as normal, but may move through 1 hex threatened by an enemy ship or creature without provoking an attack of opportunity.

#### ***The Magic Officer***
may view any maps or activate other devices that the ship has installed on-board to identify threats or escape routes, target foes, and navigate hazards. The Magic Officer may make a *Spyglass*, *Hail!*, or *Train Aim* ship action.

- *Spyglass*<br>
The *Magic Officer* scans the enemy vessel to obtain one piece of information about one other vessel:
  * Ship size class and tonnage; Number of Crew; Stations assigned on-board other vessel; Flags or markings displayed by the vessel; Current Hull Points (described in a general sense); Ship weapon(s); and any other interesting characteristics per DM discretion. A character may need to roll an associated ability check to discern meaning out of their observation.

- *Hail!*<br> Through a series of flags, lights, or other means, the Magic Officer may attempt to hail or send any message to the oncoming vessel that could be sent in one minute. The Magic Officer may perform a Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion check with the associated message, per DM discretion.

- *Train Aim*<br>
The *Magic Officer* scans the enemy vessel to find likely weak spots to attack the enemy ship or specific stations more effectively.
  *  This action may only be used the turn after a *Spyglass* ship action was used. The next attack made by your vessel that hits the enemy ship scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

```
```

<br><div style="margin-top:380px;"></div>

#### ***The Engineer***
may order crew to repair damage to the vessel or it's weapons, put out fires, perform repairs herself, or cast spells that repair or bolster the defences of the ship. Additionally, the Engineer may perform a *Rush Job*, *Brace for Impact*, and *Douse Flames*.

- *Rush Job!*<br> The Engineer orders up to five crew members to begin quickly repairing the ship. This ship action reduces the number of Hull Holed Critical Hits by one, or can repair any sheared rigging.

- *Batten Down the Hatches!*<br> The Engineer orders the crew to tie ship's belongings down to avoid jostling, and to brace for impact. Any rolls on the Critical Hits table that target your ship are negated until the beginning of your ships next turn.

- *Douse Flames!*<br> The Engineer orders up to five crew to begin dousing all flames aboard the vessel. Roll 1d4. This Ship Action douses all non-magical flame aboard the ship including torches, candles, and flame created by the *Fire!* Critical Hit in 1d4 Ship combat rounds. Crew must continue dousing flames until all fire is put out. Fires aboard a ship deal 1d6 fire damage per ship combat round. This damage is not reduced by the Damage Threshold of the ship.

</div>

# Gravity

The reason everything drags its own atmosphere around through space is gravity. This is also the reason why people can stand on a space sailing ship without falling off its deck and can stand on a spherical planet without falling off the bottom side. Every body in space has its own gravity. Gravity is an accommodating force in that its direction seems to be "that which is most convenient." In an object the size of a planet, gravity is directed toward a point at the center of the sphere so that people can stand anywhere on the surface, and dropped objects fall perpendicular to the surface. In smaller objects, like spacecraft, gravity is not a central point but rather a plane or line which cuts horizontally through the object to the end of the air envelope. Gravity itself is conveniently an all-or-nothing proposition. Either it is there at full strength or it is not there at all (though there are exceptions to every rule, per DM discretion).

Significantly, this gravity plane is two-directional; it attracts from both top and bottom. A sailor can actually stand on the bottom of the ship's hull and move around as easily as if she was walking on deck. In this case, what was "down" on the deck is actually "up", back toward the plane of gravity that cuts through the ship. One of the stranger side effects of all this is that an object falling off the side of a Spelljammer can oscillate back and forth across the plane of gravity, falling first in one direction until it crosses the plane, then reversing direction and falling back across the plane again, and so on until something causes it to stop. To a person standing on the deck, the object appears to fall down, then up, then down, then up, and so forth.

> This trick is commonly used to amuse passengers new to space travel. More than one groundling has gotten in trouble for standing at the ship's rail and tossing an endless stream of apples overboard just to watch them bob.

Along the plane an object is weightless, but it is slowly pushed out toward the edge of the gravity field. Therefore, a creature that falls overboard that couldn't find a hold or isn't tied down, would eventually come to rest at the ship's plane of gravity, and would then begin drifting away from the ship along that plane toward the edge of the air envelope. On reaching the end of the gravity plane (at the very edge of the air envelope) she is pushed out and left behind as the ship moves away. This movement takes place at a rate of 5 feet per round. Aside from this slight push, there is no relative motion of a ship within its air envelope, aside from turning. A ships air envelop does not turn with the ship when it turns, but objects in the ships air envelope do not drift toward the rear of the ship simply because the ship is moving forward.

When gravity planes intersect (such as when two ships pass each other, or when a ship passes a planetoid), the gravities of both ships remain in effect, regardless of size, up to the point where they physically intersect. An object is under the influence of whichever gravity plane it is closest to. A character could leap between two passing ships, altering her down direction as she crosses the midpoint between the two.

When two ships come into direct contact, the gravity of the ship with the higher tonnage is dominant and becomes the gravity for both ships. A large mind flayer vessel could ram a smaller ship from directly above and spin the smaller ship's gravity plane by 90 degrees, causing everything on the rammed ship to tumble toward the large ship's plane of gravity, probably with disasterous results.

A weightless character who enters the air envelope of a larger body is immediately affected by the pull of gravity on that body. She effectively falls the distance from where she entered to the surface of the body or to the gravity plane, whichever is closer. Normal falling damage is applied, as well as massive damage rules. When the drop is more than one mile, there is also danger of the subject heating up and igniting from friction with the air. This happens after one mile of uncontorlled descent. The falling object catches fire and takes normal damage from fire as well as falling damage. Any sort of control over speed and descent (flight, levitation, feather fall, etc) negates this effect.

Characters who are weightless can move under familiar laws of physics - For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. A drifting fighter may move by throwing her equpiment in the opposite direction. Max movement is half-speed when acting this way. Combat in a weightless environment is difficult and foreign to creatures used to fighting in normal environments, and any attack roll or saving throw using STR, DEX, or CON is made at disadvantage.

# Air in Space

All objects drag air with them whenever they leave an air envelope. While important, air is relatively easy to replenish. Entering a larger air envelope like that of a planet or asteroid is one of the most popular and cheapest methods. Green plants will refresh air, and some vessels make great use of these for just this purpose. Many asteroid colonies keep at least half their surface area reserved for plants for this reason.

Air around a ship remains fresh for eight months with 50% of the max crew or less. With 51% - 100% of the max crew, air lasts for four months. 101% - 150% of the max crew, and air lasts for three months. 151% - 200% of the max crew, and air lasts for 2 months. More than double the crew cannot fit on a ship, due to sleeping and space requirements. Air cannot be extended by losing crew members mid-travel, but can be shortened by adding crew members mid-travel.

For example: A 30 ton frigate sets sail with 30 crew aboard (including the party), the maximum crew size for that vessel. It has air sufficient for four months. After a week in space, 16 crew members are lost in a large space battle, making total crew of 14. Even though this represents less than 50% of the max crew, it has no effect on air supply because air supply can’t be extended mid-travel. Two weeks later, if the same 30-ton frigate rescues 34 characters from a drifting hulk of a vessel, bound together and limping along. This raises current crew to 50. This bring the total crew count greater than the max of 30. Air supply is reduced to three months, so the air will gain the fouled condition at the end of three months in space.

Any lone Medium-sized creatures in Wildspace or the Phlogiston drags along with it enough air to last 5 minutes. Large-sized creatures (ogres and giants, for example) drag along enough air to last 10 minutes. If a medium-sized creature is standing on a rock 100 cubic yards in size it may have enough air to survive several months, but food and water is another matter entirely.

```
```

*Fresh* air is completely breathable. When a body reaches its air limit, the air gains the *Fouled* condition; it smells bad and is stale and humid. Roll all attacks, checks, and saving throws in a fouled atmosphere at disadvantage. The time for air to with the fouled condition is the same time it stayed fresh, effectively resetting the timer, after which it gains the *Deadly* condition.

Deadly air is completely depleted. It cannot support life that breathes air. This happens the turn after the fouled air supply timer has run out. A creature can hold it’s breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (min. 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to it’s Constitution modifier (min. 1 round). After this, the creature falls unconscious and is dying.

A creature falling unconscious in this way in the Phlogiston is put into suspended animation until such time as they are found or their body is destroyed, whichever comes first. Their flesh turns gray and stonelike and remains that way until the individual is rescued. Some races do excellent business in robbing and enslaving the unfortunate individuals they find adrift in the depths of Phlogiston.

When two bodies meet in space, their atmosphere is exchanged. The class of air (Fresh or Fouled) in the body that is smaller becomes that of the larger body. If the smaller body is at least 50% of the tonnage of the larger, both get one half as much air as the larger had remaining. If the smaller is less than 50% the size of the larger, both get the largers full supply of air, minus one week. The same rules apply for individual creatures, except on the smaller scale.

Creatures that do not breathe (undead, golems, etc) are unaffected by the status of the air envelopes but still carry the envelops and exchange air. The envelope still depletes as normal.

# Universal Magic

The Wizard and Artificer have learned to bend the very magical essence of the universe through study, and the Sorcerer and Mystic through sheer force of will or personality. Clerics and Paladins receive their spells through the offices of her deity, and the Druid and Ranger pull on the very essence of terrestrial bodies themselves. Lastly, Warlocks have been gifted the source of their power from their respective patrons. This all may change in the universe, and no two places may change in the same way.

The effects of certain arcane and divine spells and spell-like abilities are limited in the Phlogiston that lies between Crysal Spheres. The power of the helm allows individuals to operate a Spelljamming Helm in the flow without consequence, but magic use may be severely hampered or twisted in the Phlogiston due to its turbulent nature, and may operate differently at different times.

### Spell Ranges
In space, any spells with a five mile or less range may only target creatures or objects that are in an adjacent hex space. Any spells with a larger than five mile radius, or that have a range of Sight, may effect creatures or objects on the battlefield if you can clearly see the target. Outside of ship combat, any spells with a larger than five mile radius is up to DM discretion.

```
```

### Gods and Patrons
*Optionally*, DM's may consider limiting spells from the Druid, Ranger, Cleric, Paladin, and Warlock classes above 3rd level in a sphere that a deity or patron is not recognized in. It will be necessary to contact a local group that can assist in providing an alliance with a God or Patron to regain full spellcasting ability. In general, Gods with the same or similar Domains have an alliance and will be able to convey magic ability, sometimes for a fee or with the completion of a quest. Similarly, pulling from the very essense of nature may be difficult if the world is too foreign.

If a deity is worshipped in the Crystal Shell the party are touring (or if the DM chooses not to use this optional rule) then magic works the same in all Crystal Shells, regardless of the existence of any Gods or Patrons there.

You can also begin the process of starting a church by performing the Sacred Rites of your deity, and gaining Renown. See pg. 129 of the *The Dungeon Masters Guide* for downtime activities or pgs. 123-134 in *Xanthar's Guide to Everything* for a revision of these rules. Generally, several weeks of daily performance of Sacred Rites and proselytizing can either start the recognition of your deity or patron in whatever Crystal Shell you are visiting, or attract the attention of a power that is able to relay magical ability. The DM is encouraged to work with the players to set a reasonable amount of time based on the limits or freedoms of time in the campaign, if you use this optional rule.

```
```

### Teleportation and the Realms
Spells and Spell-like abilities that call upon beings from the surrounding area will not function if none of those creatures are located within the spells range (ie. Calling upon local animals to aid in battle or to give information can't work if you're millions of miles from a habitable place). Conjuration/Summoning spells will not work in the Phlogiston if they summon extra dimensional monsters or powers. No power, God, elemental, or other meta-planar creature can be summoned in the Phlogiston, and any spell that attempts to do so will automatically fail. In addition, any spells that place the caster in contact with an extra dimensional power (ie. Gods or Patrons) automatically fails in the Phlogiston.

Travel between the planes of existence functions normally within the various Crystal Shells. A character in Wildspace may become ethereal, enter the *Astral Plane*, or open a gate into one of the outer planes. In the Phlogiston, however, other dimensions cannot be accessed. Therefore, devices and spells (ie. *Bags of Holding*, or *Contact Other Plane*) will not function. A device or spell that holds objects in external dimensions will still hold them, but the items cannot be accessed. The items will become mundane, non-magical equipment. Items that are magically non-functional in this way regain their ability upon re-entering a crystal shell. Any effects are essentially placed "on hold" until that time.

### Fire
Within an air envelope, fire burns normally. Outside of an air envelope in Wildspace, there is a vacuum that will not support fire. Magical fire (such as the *Fireball* spell) will work in the vacuum of Wildspace as it is the sudden creation of fire that requires no air, though it will not cause anything outside of an air envelope to burst into flame, as no air exists to support the fire.

Within the Phlogiston however, fire woks all too well. This affects both non-magical and magical flame. All effects from creating a flame (from the spark of a match to a 9th-level *Fireball*) are increased by 3x and explode immediately upon existence. This is such that igniting a match will cause serious burns (1d6 damage), and casting a 3rd level *Fireball* spell will cause an intense eruption of flame (24d6 damage) conveniently centered where it is cast (For example, in the hands of the Wizard casting it, before it can be moved away from said Wizard). It is advised to extinguish all flame-based light on the ship, and to avoid bringing Alchemist Fire into the Phlogiston.

# Spells

This chapter offers new spells for many of the classes in the Player's Handbook. The spells provide various way to harness the power of Wildspace and The Phlogiston. Your DM determines whether these spells are available at character creation, whether they are discovered drifting in the ruins of wrecked vessels, or whether you stumble upon them in an ancient library or other storehouse of magical knowledge.

##### 1st Level
###### *Create or Destroy Air*

Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger

##### 2nd Level
###### *Portal Magic*

Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

##### 3rd Level
###### *Contact Home Power*

Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger

##### 4th Level
###### *Softwood*

Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger

##### 5th Level
###### *Create Helm*

Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

```
```

#### Create or Destroy Air
*1st level Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A small, stoppered flask)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

You either create or destroy air.

*Create Air*

You replace, replenish, and refresh the air in a personal air envelope for 10 minutes for any creature within range, including air poisoned/tained by spells such as *Cloudkill* and *Stinking Cloud*. This does not create a larger in size envelope, but simply replenishes the air in the envelope that the creature drags with it. If the air is fouled, the air turns fresh again and the air timer resets to 10 minutes. If used within a spell or effect that causes a cloud (similar to the *Fog Cloud*, *Cloudkill* and *Stinking Cloud* spells) the creature is allowed an immediate save against the effects of the spell.

*Destroy Air*

The air envelope of a target creature within range immediately is reduced to *Fouled* status, with all effects of *Fouled* status. If air is already *Fouled* status, this spell has no effect.

*At higher levels*

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you may target one additional creature for each slot above 1st.

\page

#### Portal Magic
*2nd level Divination (Ritual)*
___
- **Casting time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Half a mile
- **Components:** V, S, M (A conch shell)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

Casting out to the very Crystal Shell itself, you can sense the direction and distance (either in miles or in travel time) of the nearest portal of egress through a Crystal Shell.

In general, from any point on a Crystal Shell, naturally occurring portals for a ship are 2d10 days away. At DM’s discretion, there may be more, less, or no portals.

This spell may only be cast within half a mile of the surface of a Crystal Shell.

*At Higher Levels*

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you may draw a circle in the air towards the Crystal Shell. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open for five minutes. The opening does not weaken the shell, and any objects resting physically on the shell are unaffected by the portal.

Portals created by this spell are magical and temporary, so they can be dispelled. If the portal is dispelled or otherwise prematurely closed, roll 1d10, and determine the result the fate of the object(s) passing through the opening as it closes:

- 1-5 - Portal closes before ship reaches the shell. Ship must turn back using a Stunt, or Crash into the shell.
- 6-10 - Portal closes after ship passes through.

#### Contact Home Power
*3rd level Conjuration (Ritual)*
- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (A small toy horn, to be blown)
- **Duration:** One week, or until you leave the current Crystal Shell

You mentally establishes a tenuous link through the Astral Plane between your present location and that of the power you receive guidance from. This link permits the Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, and Warlock to regain spells above 3rd level as if their divine link was revered in the Crystal Sphere they currently reside.

Distance has no effect upon the attempt to contact the home power, but dimensional gates, anti-magic fields, and the effects of dispel magic will prevent the use of the spell. Additionally, the spell will not function in areas that power has been specifically banished from (whether from *Banishment* or some previous action by the power itself).

If power is forbidden, the caster will be informed through the spell that such contact is forbidden, but not the reason why. Passage into another plane, or into the ethereal will break the connection. While the spell is in effect, the caster will react positively to a *Detect Magic* spell.

The spell cannot be cast in the Phlogiston.

```
```

#### Softwood
*4th level Transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of tree bark)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into a soft, spongy lump of wood, similar to that of a rotting stump.

The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to grow mossy and brown. On a successful save, the creature isn’t affected. A creature restrained by this spell may make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails saves three times, it is turned to softwood and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw.

The softwood lump is immune to all damage. A character turned to softwood could fall to Earth and the heat and impact of the fall would be absorbed by the spell.

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to softwood until the effect is removed., or until the target is brought into contact with open air for 30 minutes, such as the air on a planetoid or ship.

#### Create Helm
*5th level Enchantment (Ritual)*
___
- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (Chair, stool, or other seat-like object)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

By casting this spell on a normal chair or other seat, this spell transforms that chair or seat into a Spelljammer Helm suitable for powering a Spelljamming ship. The Helm this spell creates provides a Helm rating of 1:3, similar to a Minor Helm. If this Helm is dispelled, the chair or other seat used for the Material component of this spell is destroyed.

You can Create a permanent Helm by casting this spell on the same seat-like object every day for one year. You need not use the Helm this spell creates when you cast the spell this way.

# Feats

##### **Rocket Rider**

Being in space away from your ship allows you to think clearer than your allies, and your ability to maneuver isn't hindered by the pesky lack of gravity.

- Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You roll with advantage on ability checks and saving throws when in zero gravity.
- Your air envelope lasts twice as long in zero gravity. This does not include when on a ship or planet.
- You can go without food and water for twice as long.
- When in an environment of extreme heat or extreme cold, you have advantage on constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion.

##### **Nomad**
You are a traveler, flitting from port to port, world to world, and are an expert at navigating your way throughout Wildspace and the Phlogiston. You've seen things, been there, and it shows:

- You have advantage on Survival checks to navigate and Perception checks that rely on Sight in Wildspace and the Phlogiston.
- The Speed of a ship that crews a character with the Nomad feat is increased by 1.
- You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to avoid gaining the Poisoned, Diseased, Charmed, and Restrained conditions.
- You have advantage on Persuasion checks when attempting to recruit new crew members.

```
```

##### **Handyman**
You've pulled your share of all-nighters keeping up with a busy ship, and it shows. You are more prepared for anything the void might throw at you, the crew seems to hang on your every word, and the safety of a million spinning worlds is on your shoulders. You've got this; All you have to do is breathe.

- You gain proficiency with Water and Spelljamming vehicles. Proficiency with Spelljamming vehicles covers a wide range of options, from sea-based ships with helms installed to purpose-built spaceships that were meant to fly. Proficiency with vehicles grants the knowledge needed to handle vehicles of that type, along with knowledge of how to repair and maintain them. In addition, a character proficient with Spelljamming vehicles is knowledgeable about anything a professional sailor would be familiar with, such as information about wildspace, the phlogiston, planets, spheres, tying knots, and assessing safe harbors.
- During each Ship Action combat phase, you can perform two total ship actions from two ship roles rather than one. The same action cannot be performed twice in the same ship combat round. These ship actions may be selected from different Stations.
- You automatically succeed on any Ship Shaken critical hit rolls to avoid being knocked prone.
- You have advantage on all concentration checks against Spelljammer Shock.
- Damage to you from the Deck Crew Damage or Interior Crew Damage critical hits is reduced to 0.

# Celestial Mechanics

Traveling in a straight line, Spelljamming ships can attain extremely high velocity relatively quickly, spanning the great emptiness between planets in a short time. On the other hand, planets and other space-bourne bodies move relatively slow; so slowly that they can be thought of as being a fixed point on a map, similar to a town on any overworld map you may have seen previously. You can think of mapping the star chart of Wildspace itself similarly to a massive Dungeon as well; treating rooms as stars and planets, rubble as asteroid fields, stairs as wormholes, etc. This chapter will help you create the star systems to fill your campaigns.

Whether operating under Newtonian physics, riding on the back of giant turtles, or rolling across a velvet pool table of the gods, most planets behave in a similar fashion. There are systems where the planets operate in a totally chaotic manner, as well as those where the planets are truly unmoving points in the night sky. There are crystal shells so small that they contain only a single world. There are shells which contain one single flat disk that extends to the very edges of the sphere, and spheres which may contain more spheres. Most systems have a central fire world (think *Sol*, the star of our solar system), and all planets will be rotating around that central fire world. Use the rules below to help create the Crystal Shells in your game.

### Creating your Universe

Use the tables below to create a planetary system from scratch; there are seven steps:

1. **Type of System:** Is it a standard system (planets orbiting around a central point), or special system?
2. **Primary Body:** What is the primary body, for which all planets orbit around? (Planet, Black Hole, etc)
3. **Number of planets:** How many main planets orbit the primary body?
4. **Orbits and Placement:** What are the orbital rings of each body? Where are they located relative to each other?
5. For each body:
* What is its **size**?
* What is its **type**?
* What is its **shape**?
* Any other **notes**: such as moons or inhabitants?
6. **Population and Technology Level:** Is there any civilization? Do some or all of the civilizations in this area have Spelljamming capabilities?
7. **Distance:** What is the distance to the Crystal Shell of the system? (twice the orbit of the furthest major body)

```
```

The type of system you create guides the rest of this section, and will determine the overall structure of the galaxy contained within a Crystal Shell. After this step, proceed through the rest of the steps to determine the makeup of your randomly generated star system.

### 1. Type of system

| D10  | Type  |
|:---|:-----------:|
| 1-7 | Standard System |
| 8-10 | Special System; Roll another 1d10 and use result below |
|  | **Special Systems** |
|  1-2 | Fixed System; Planets don't rotate around central point |
|  3-4 | Chaotic/Random movement |
|  5-6 | Semi-random movement |
|  7-8 | Strange; See note below |
|    9 | Void (Nothing; or debris); Stop rolling |
|   10 | Nested Spheres; After creating the first system, create another to determine second system |

<br>In the case of a *Strange* roll, use your imagination and speak to your players to come up with what the sphere contains.

In the case of a *Void* roll, don't assume a "Void" as lacking story elements. An entire Crystal Sphere of planet debris definitely has a story to tell . . .

This is not an exhaustive list; Your sphere could contain Planets mounted on enormous clockwork gears, spinning indefinitely; Planets eternally tumbling down a hill; Planets on the backs of titans; Planets nestled as berries in an enormous tree; or on the pool table/chess board of the gods and titans themselves.

 <div style="margin-top:430px;"></div>

### 2. Primary Body

|**D10**|**Body**|
|:-----:|:-----:|
|1-6|Fire body (like the Sun)|
|7|Earth body (like Earth)|
|8|Wind body (like a Gas Giant)
|9|Water bodies (like a planet of mostly ocean or ice)|
|10|Special (Roll on table below)|
|**D10**|**Special**|
|1|Portal to Outer Plane|
|2|Portal to Plane of Elemental Fire|
|3|Portal to Plane of Elemental Earth|
|4|Portal to Plane of Elemental Water|
|5|Portal to Plane of Elemental Air|
|6|Portal to Positive Material Plane|
|7|Portal to Negative Material Plane|
|8|1d4 Primary Bodies|
|9|Portal to another shell|
|10|Liveworld|

The Primary Body of a Crystal Shell is the central point of a Crystal Sphere. Think of this like a star. Usually, it is a fire body like the Sun of our solar system, but other possibilities may occur that can be interesting points in your campaign.

A Liveworld is a living being, the size of a planet, that sits as the center of a Crystal Sphere.

If a Portal to an Outer Plane is rolled, Roll 1d8 and use the chart below to determine the plane that exists on the other end of the portal. Optionally, the DM may create a plane of her choosing.

|**D8**|**Result**|
|:-----:|:-----:|
|1|Abaddon - Lawful Evil|
|2|Avalon - Lawful Good|
|3|Duma - Neutral Evil|
|4|Malebolge - Chaotic Evil|
|5|Nirvana - Neutral Good|
|6|Purgatory - Lawful Neutral|
|7|Valhalla - Chaotic Good|
|8|Vigrond - Chaotic Neutral|

You can read more about other Planes by referring to the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, Chapter 2.

### 3. Number of Planets

Roll 2d10 to determine the number of planets in the system. You may also choose to replace one of the planets with an asteroid field.

You may want to have more planets or a single planet in the system you create. The DM is advised to use her discretion in determining how many planets each galaxy contains - too many planets may be difficult to keep track of.

### 4. Orbits and Placement

Standard systems orbiting around a Primary body have a perfectly circular orbit (This is to keep with our simple random generation theme). In order to place our planets in this system easily, we have 100 circular "rings", stepping increasingly away from the Primary Body in 50 million mile (A half-days of travel) increments; Planets and other space-bourne bodies can only appear on these rings, and the rings represent their orbital trajectory around the Primary Body.

A Spelljamming ship in Wildspace travels at 100 million miles in a 24 hour period (about 4 million miles per hour). This means that, from the Primary Body to the closest point on the first "ring", it will take 12 hours of uninterruped travel in a Spelljamming ship. From the Primary Body to the closest point of the final "ring" (Ring number 100), it takes 50 days of uninterrupted travel in a Spelljamming ship.

For each of the planets created, roll a D100 to determine what ring you will place it on. If you roll the same number twice, you can choose to either re-roll or move the planet to an adjacent ring. Keep in mind that familiarity breeds contempt, and neighboring planets may not be on the best of terms . . .

\page

<img src='https://openclipart.org/download/224584/FightingSkeleton.svg' style='position:absolute;top:30px;left:30px;width:51%;mix-blend-mode:multiply;transform:scaleX(1)rotate(7deg)'/>

 <div style="margin-top:590px;"></div>

Planets rotating around a Primary Body aren't always in perfect alignment and right next to one-another for simple travel. Earth and Mars are sometimes on opposite sides of the Sun, so to travel from the Earth to Mars will take time to reach the Sun, and then more time to reach Mars. You can determine the positions of your planets upon creation of the galaxy by dividing all rings into eight separate sections. Draw 6 separate, equally spaced straight lines extending outwards from the Primary Body, like lines extending from a central point to the points of a hexagon. Numbering them in successive order, roll 1d6 for each planet or other space-bourne body to determine which section the planet starts in on the ring.

Optionally, the DM may rotate their planets around the central body if the campaign lasts for a extended time -- Rings 1 - 25 complete a rotation around the central body in half a standard Earth year, rings 26-50 take one standard Earth year, rings 51-75 take a standard Earth year and a half, and rings 76-100 take two standard Earth years.

It's generally advised to use the average distance when informing players of travel time between two space-bourne bodies, to keep things simple. The average relative travel time between the Earth and Mars would be relayed as 34 hours, or just under a day and a half. Optionally, the furthest or closest distance that the planets could be on their rotation could be taken into account when determining travel distance. For example, the closest distance from Earth to Mars would take as little as 8.5 hours of travel in a Spelljamming vessel whereas farthest distance would take 2.5 days in a Spelljamming vessel. That may be a lot to keep track of, so make a decision and stick with what you are comfortable with.

You may also choose to have these planets orbit on more than or less than circular orbital trajectory, similarly to real life (also giving a scientific evidence to the reason for seasons). For ease of calculating distances with this option, the ellipses you create will still step out from the Primary Body. The distance to the closest point will be half that of a perfect circle, and the distance to the farthest point will be double that of a perfect circle. For example, the closest point of the first ellipse will take merely 6 hours to reach by Spelljamming vessel, but the farthest point in the first ellipse will take a full day's travel (24 hours). Likewise the closest point on ellipse number 100 will take 25 days to reach, but the farthest point will take 100 days to reach.

### 5. Planet statistics

There are six sizes of Celestial bodies, listed as Size A through F. They are referred to as Tiny (A), Small (B), Medium (C), Large (D), Huge (E), and Gargantuan (F).

Earth, and most Earth-like fantasy campaigns, are Size C.

A Celestial body containing a gravity well and/or atmosphere is any body of 10 tons or greater space displacement (300 cubic feet, or a cube slightly less than 14 feet on a side). Small items such as Rowboats and Elvish Flitters which rate under 10 tons do not have this effect. The bright star at the very center is a planet of pure fire. The block of ice on the outermost edge is also a planet. The systems you generate do not have to make sense in a "Goldilocks Zone" fashion.

Roll 1d6 on the table below to determine planet size:

##### Celestial Body Size Categories

|1d6|**Class**|**Measurement**|
|:-:|:-----|:-----|
|1|Size A|Less than 100 miles across
|2|Size B|101-10,000 miles across
|3|Size C|10,001-100,000 miles across
|4|Size D|100,001-1,000,000 miles across
|5|Size E|1,000,001-10,000,000 miles across
|6|Size F|10,000,001 miles across or greater

\page

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/YBPYetO.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:50px;left:63px;width:35%;mix-blend-mode:multiply;transform:scaleX(-1)rotate(0deg)'/>

Each planet in your galaxy may be a different shape. Roll below to determine the shape of the planet that is encountered. Remember, gravity on a spherical world is a central point at the center of world, and gravity on a Spelljamming ship is a straight line, bisecting the ship itself. Keep this in mind when the planet shape is determined.

##### Planet Shape

|**D10 Roll**|**Planet Shape**|
|:-:|:-:|
|1|Amorphous/Irregular|
|2|Cluster|
|3|Cubic
|4-6|Spherical|
|7|Flatworld|
|8|Elliptical|
|9|Triangular|
|10|Belt/Ring|

When a Spelljamming ship encounters a planet, the planet will also have a prevailing terrain type, largely determined by its overall planetary conditions. Roll twice on the table below to determine a generalized, overall planetary condition; Your first roll will be the "Main" condition type, and the second roll will be a "Sub" condition, to give you ideas on how to flavor the worlds that fill your skies. Remember that civilization will thrive in many conditions, and adventure should be able to happen anywhere to keep your players interested.

##### Planet Conditions

**D4**|**Conditions**
:-----:|:-----
1|Air ("Gas Giant" Planet; May not have land-able surface; "Surface" may consist of floating islands)
2|Earth (Jungle/Forest/Plains/Hills/Mountains)
3|Water (Water/Ice/Steam)
4|Fire (Desert/Mountains/Lava)

For example, a Water/Earth planet may generate the Earth we know in our solar system, and an Earth/Fire planet may generate the Mars we know in our solar system. In the case of rolling the same type of conditions for both the Main- and Sub-type, the condition that's rolled would be overwhelmingly abundant on the planet, such as a planet made entirely of water or jungle.

```
```

For each planet in your galaxy roll 1d12 on the table below:

##### Moons

**d12**|**Moon Type**
:-----:|:-----:
1-7|No moons
8|Planetary ring
9|1d4 barren moons
10|Habitable moon: roll on Planet Color table for technology level, and on Planet Conditions table for conditions
11|Colony/Mine
12|Roll 1d8+2 twice on this table

### 6. Population and Technology

When players enter a dungeon room, they are able to ascertain information from the various objects in the room. The same will show for the galaxy's you create. There are several planet types that can be encountered, and their color (shown on a map or display, or seen twinkling from a distance in a spyglass) may show a generalized society and technology level that will be encountered when visiting that star.

##### Planet Color

**D8**|**Planet Color**
:-----:|:-----
1|Red
2|Orange
3|Yellow
4|Green
5|Blue
6|Violet
7|Black
8|White
<br>

**Red**- Dead; littered with forgotten dungeons, relics, and ancient evil. Has no life, or almost no life.<br>
**Orange**- Dying; Post-societial barbarism. Civilization has collapsed, for the most part. Remnants of old, broken technology and magic.<br>
**Yellow**- Primeval; Large swaths of unexplored wilderness. Beginnings of civilization.<br>
**Green**- Early Civilization; Possibility of early firearms.<br>
**Blue**- Civilized; Generally advised to be approximately equal to the PC's technology level.<br>
**Violet**- Highly Advanced; Generally advised to contain technology more advanced or different than the current technology the PC's have seen.<br>
**Black**- This planet appears dark, almost silhouetted against the void of space. It hides it's true technology level. Roll 1d6 on Planet Color table to determine the stars actual technology level, keeping the Black color.<br>
**White**- Sentient planet with mystical powers.<br><br>

Now that you've created the universe, you've got to fill it with adventure and mystery for your players. There are several types of encounters that can take place in the depths of space and on the surface (or below the surface) of a planet.

### Random Encounters

While real life space is filled with empty void, fantasy wildspace is a place of exciting intrigue. Roll on the table below to use as idea seeds to fill your campaign with interesting events.

##### Random Encounter Table

| D20 | Random Encounter |
|:-:|:-:|
|1|Planetary/Wildspace Storm |
|2|Space Pirates |
|3|Space and/or Time Anomaly |
|4|Dead Ship, with no distress signal |
|5|NPC in space (clinging to floating debris) |
|6|Random Dragon Encounter |
|7|Large NPC convoy of ships, guarded |
|8|Ship encounter, same size as party's ship |
|9|1d4 vessels, in the midst of combat |
|10|Ancient space probe, similar to the *Voyager*|
|11|Crew-related Event: intruder, stowaway, sickness, etc |
|12|Ship encounter, smaller than party's ship |
|13|Trader encounter |
|14|Harmless School of random beast encounter |
|15|Ship encounter, larger than party's ship |
|16|Boarding Party |
|17|Undead Encounter |
|18|Cargo related event |
|19|Dead Ship, signalling distress |
|20|Space Leviathan |

### Everything Else

Thinking of the galaxy we've created here, we've come up with the overall feel of the inside of this Crystal Shell, the Primary Body, all celestial bodies that surround it, as well as a generalized look and feel of each of those bodies, and seeds to what those bodies contain. The rules listed here show how to survive and thrive in this new place. It is now up to the DM to determine what to fill each of these worlds with.

Entire campaigns have taken place on single planets, continents, and even in single cities. Spelljammer is no different; the worlds you create can be as many and varied as the number of stars in the sky. The only differences are that now, entire campaigns will be able to span millions of potential worlds and touch the lives of the various beings that exist there. The only limit is your imagination.<br><br>

See you space cowboy.

#### Crew

Listed crew size is for humans. If the crew is composed of kobolds or other small creatures, the minimum crew size is increased to 12 and similarly the maximum crew is increased to 66. The helm and bridge of the Angelship lie in a large central chamber positioned where the wings meet the hull of the ship. Crew quarters are located forward of the bridge, just behind the front ram, and in warrens in the wings. The galley is located aft of the bridge, and the cargo holds are located aft of that.

#### Ship Uses

**Trading** The Angelship is able to easily take off and land at land-based ports, making it idea as a trading vessel and at one time were the most popular merchant vessel in the void.
Bulk Cargo Hauling - Stripped down versions of the Angelship have seen service as bulk cargo transports. They are less sturdy than their standard counterparts, due to hollowing out of the interior, but these changes increase the cargo space by 26 tons, to a total of 47 tons.
**Naval Fleet** The Angelship has long since fallen out of favor in modern space navies, primarily due to its small size. However, Kobolds have continued to use stealth versions of the Angelship, painted flat black and cloaked with darkness and invisibility spells. This particular type of Angelship is commonly known as the Dark Angel, and is used for sneak attacks.

#### Other Configurations
No known modifications exist.

### Antlership

### Argosy

### Armada

### Hammership
Another standard human ship of space, the Hammership is large and powerful, capable of withstanding large amounts of punishment, and dealing out a significant amount with its blunt ram and heavy weapons. If the Squid Ship is the medium warship of space, this is the heavy galleon. Hammerships are found, with minor modifications to their design, throughout known space. The Hammership's design has been relatively unchanged, such that hulks hundreds of years old resemble those under construction in modern dry docks. Even the illithids and the elves, with their own distinctive ships, use the Hammership design for workhorse and supply situations.

#### Crew
The "brains" of the Hammership are in the heavily protected forward section. Both the helm and the bridge are located in this section, behind the massive bulwarks and the blunt ram. Often this area is plated with heavy metals, ivory, or bone to provide extra strength. The lenses of the Hammership's "eyes" are often made of paneless glass, but in some (more expensive) versions are constructed of glassteel. The captain usually operates from a base behind these windows, commanding both the ship and the forward weapons placements, while the first officer is usually stationed at the rear catapult.
#### Ship Uses
The Hammership is a versital ship found all over Realmspace and beyond.

**Trading** A Hammership requires a larger crew than the more common Squid Ships or Tradesmen, but it can carry more cargo, and is a daunting vessel for a pirate to attack. This makes it ideal for carrying large bulk cargos. Such ships frequently run on a minimum crew, unless they are passing through a contested area of space, in which case the captain will usually take on a full crew, including whatever battle wizards and priests he can hire. Some mind flayers use Hammerships as free traders, unaligned to any illithid faction or house. This is particularly common in those areas of space where Nautiloids are frequently fired-upon on sight. The eyes of Hammerships controlled by mind flayers are usually covered over with steel plates.


\page



**Piracy** Though not commonly used as a pirate vessel, the Hammership is the favorite craft of some of the most stylish and brazen pirates and privateers in known space, including the legendary Bloodjack of Realmspace. His Hammership is dyed in shades of red, supposedly representing the the blood he and his ship, the Lucky Victory, have spilled over a career spanning a decade. The size of a Hammership makes it ideal for prolonged battles - just the sort of conflict Bloodjack seems to revel in. Most pirates and privateers, however, prefer smaller swifter ships which will allow them to board an enemy as quickly as possible, thus avoiding a long space battle.

**Military** The Hammership is a common armada craft, capable of hauling many men across space, and returning with supplies to support an invasion. For intra-sphere uses, such craft frequently carry up to 200 soldiers (including the crew), although this is obviously not possible for longer voyages unless magic is used to keep the air envelope fresh and the crew provisioned. Hammerships can be considered to be the standard heavy warship of most human nations.

**Elven Support Ship** Hammerships are sometimes used by the Imperial Elven Navy, primarily as supply and troop ships. The Hammership's bulk and heavy handling (compared to most elven craft) make it unsuitable for the elven style of space combat, relegating it to the role of support ship. Hammerships which the elves believe may see combat may be stripped, reducing AR to 8 but increasing MC to C. Topping out is not a popular option, since the elves prefer to operate their Hammerships with as few trained sailors as

```
```
 possible, instead sending such trained elves to the more important Men-o-War and Armadas which make up the main elven battle line. Troop ships, however, may be topped out.

**Multiple Turrets** Some versions of the Hammership mount extra turrets for large weapons (ballistas or catapults depending on the tastes of the owner). A typical configuration will include two extra turrets on the main deck. Some versions will remove the overhead hatch of the cargo hold in order to place a third turret, instead using newly-built side hatches for access to the cargo bay. This makes the ship leaky and dangerous to land on water. Such ships may even place one or more turrets on the underside of the ship, making a landing of any sort impossible. These heavily-armed vessels are typically only used by military forces for relatively short-range work, since they are extremely deadly, but cargo space drops dramatically (as well as operational flexibility for those no longer able to land safely).

**Lizard Man Vessels** Hammerships operated by lizard men will typically have the ship's central deck flooded to provide a relaxation area for the crew. This also serves as a fire-control mechanism for the ship, which will frequently see bombards used in place of the catapults, and a greek fire projector in place of the ballista. Unfortunately for the lizard men, this fire control mechanism is frequently unsuccessful, since any powder stores must be kept dry to remain useful, and if a spark ignites nearby, there is often not enough time to fetch water from the central deck before the stores explode.

### Man-O-War

Built on the largest grown hull commonly available in space, the Elvish Man-O-War is an extremely versatile craft. Its basic design is derived from the much smaller Elvish Cutter, but the Man-O-War is a much sturdier and heavily armed warship. The ship follows the same basic forms of all elvish ships; a titanic butterfly in space.

In its basic form, the Man-O-War is a far-ranging warship. Its weapons are distributed throughout the craft for advantageous firing positions and to prevent a single mass damage spell from disabling them all. The "head" of the craft serves, like on the Cutter, as a weapons pit for two medium ballista. Unlike the cutter, the head is much bigger and there is room for a medium catapult on top. This catapult does not take up the entire space, as elvish archers like to use the forward deck as the prime position for them to rain down their deadly arrows on enemy ships. Behind the catapult is the bridge, where the captain commands the ship. He communicates with the rest of the ship via voice tubes (sometimes magical). The helm is located here as well, reducing risks of miscommunication between the captain and the helmsman. Above the bride is another catapult, protected in a turret.

Behind the bridge is a massive open space, capped by a hemispherical glass ceiling. This space was purposely added by elvish designers to make the craft one of the most versatile in space. It is easily modifiable, and can be changed to suit the needs of the ship's owner or the mission. At times, it serves as a garden, a barracks, a cargo bay, or a hanger. Ships that have fallen into other races' hands have a variety of other uses for this space as well.

Beyond this space is the quarters of the captain and his officers. Their quarters are the most spacious and of the best quality on the ship. Above the officer quarters is the flight deck, which serves as landing platform for flitters of the Navy. The rear section of the flight deck is another weapons platform for two more medium ballista.

The main deck, below the command deck, is the largest section of the craft. The quarters of the sailors, marines, and the weapon teams are all located on this deck. Guest quarters and even a brig are also located on this deck.

The lowest deck, with an opposite gravity plane than the upper decks, is the observation deck. The galley, mess hall, and special rooms for mages are all part of this deck. Some ships have libraries and magical labs for onboard mages, while others convert the space into quarters for priests.
#### Crew
An elvish Man-O-War needs surprisingly few men to fly or fight. A mere dozen sailors are needed to keep the vast wings of the craft under control. Another twenty elves are needed to man all the weapons, leaving almost thirty elvish marines and archers to conduct boarding operations and man archery nests. The captain, the helmsman, the ship's primary mage, and at least four guards will always be located on the bride. Archers will be located on the forecastle and the flight deck. Marines pretty much roam the rest of the ship, filling in for those who fall in battle and stand ready for boarding actions.

#### Ship Uses
A versitle military ship.

**Patrol** One of the primary purposes of the Man-O-War is as a deep range patrol ship. The elves have special configuration for this type of mission. The multi-purpose space behind the bridge is converted into a massive garden. This garden, lit by magical lights and watered by magical spells, is large enough to freshen the entire air envelope. In this fashion the craft can remain in deep space for as long as the food and water holds out. Some craft equipped with magical items can remain in space for years at a time. This is the type of craft most often encountered by ships of other races in space. It is also the most common warship of the fleet.
\page
<br>

**Light Carrier** This type of ship is not commonly seen these days. The armada has replaced most of these craft, but they are still seen in some spheres. To fill this role, the multi-purpose space is converted into a hanger for two flitters, with another two flitters able to attach on the roof of the hanger. To launch, there is a large set of doors set in the side of the ship. A flitter is attached on top of each wing, and another flitter is hung underneath each wing. One last flitter is docked on the flight deck. In total, this ship is capable of launching a squad of nine flitters. This type of ship is most commonly used to support command ships and is most often found in larger fleets. Typically, 1-4 of these ships will be found in the larger fleets.

**Troop Carrier** Sometimes the Fleet will have need to transport a large number of troops over a long distance. The Patrol-configured Man-O-War is especially good for this, as the interior garden provides enough air for almost 200 people. Typically, a troop carrier will have a full crew in addition to fifty-to-one hundred and fifty additional troops. Parts of the ship may be converted into barracks to house so many men. However, with the need for air eliminated, the elves can transport the troops farther and faster than fleets using more conventional ships. These ships are either converted to make landings or have a number of flitters onboard (attached to the wings) to deploy troops.

**Trader/Cargo Hauler** The most common non-military craft the elves use, a trader Man-O-War most often converts the garden into a second cargo hold. This gives them an additional 12 tons of cargo space. This modification is most commonly seen on in-system traders; most flow-running traders forgo the additional cargo space for the advantages of the large garden. The Fleet sometimes uses this configuration of Man-O-War to support their larger fleets.

**Command Craft** In the days before the elvish Armada, this craft was a common sight. They served as flagships for virtually every fleet the elves had. However, recently, they were replaced by the Armada. Most were converted into deep patrol craft, while others were mothballed. They are now found in spheres without a large elvish presence (such as spheres without any resident elves). These ships will serve as flag for a small fleet of 2-5 elvish cutters.

For this duty, the Man-O-War's hull is strengthened to hold a pair of towers (located over the gardens). The first tower is two stories tall, and serves as a turret for an additional medium ballista. The two levels below the ballista serve as barracks and an armory. The second tower, over three and a half stories tall, is the office and private chambers for the admiral assigned to the craft. The tower also holds a room for his personal aide and secretary.
```
```
#### Other Configurations
<br>

**Saloon** In at least one case, an enterprising band of elves and dwarves have bought a Man-O-War from the Fleet and converted it into a roaming saloon. They travel the spacelanes, looking for ships with thirsty crews. The prices they charge are high, but men on long voyages with no sign of civilization in sight are more than willing to pay. They also sell star charts and directions to those that have become lost. Their ship, the Thirsty Tankard, is a welcomed sight in many spheres. Even pirates and raiders will not attack it; any ship that does can expect immediate attacks from ships the Tankard has serviced. Even the Fleet has toyed with the idea of introducing such craft into their larger fleets to boost morale.

**Temple** Sometimes powerful elvish priests will decide to go on long missions to convert elves in other spheres to their faith. To this end they use specially converted Men-O-War as mobile shrines. The crew are always drawn from the faithful and are loyal to the priest. With their faith guiding them, these brave elves search the spheres for lost elvish colonies and worlds that have not received the benefit of their "enlightenment." Depending on the situation, these ships are either welcomed or shot at on sight.

### Wasp
The Wasp is a variant on the theme of the Dragonfly, built to suit the needs of lizard men. One of the first vessels designed and built with the lizard man in mind, the Wasp looks slapdash and poorly engineered. In fact, the Wasp performs adequately if not exceptionally. The lower decks of the central section are bowed outward and flooded for use by the lizard men, and as a storage area for their pets. The raised hump on the wasp's back provides high ground for the ship's main weapon turret, usually a heavy ballista.

#### Crew
Lizard men normally have a single captain and a shaman responsible for the splljamming helm (often with one or more apprentices serving as backup helmsmen). Beyond that, tasks are shared without official positions. The weapons teams usually consist of those lizard men closest to the weapons at the time of a battle. In battle the captain is usually stationed either on the foredeck or at the ballista turret, where he can lead by example, while the helm and charts are kept below the foredeck. While there are official "crew quarters" aboard the ship, these are usually reserved for the captain and shaman; the rest of the crew generally bunks down in any available space. Many lizard man ships carry "crew mascots" in the flooded cargo area. These mascots are often schools of fish, such as groupers or small sharks, and are sometimes used to feed the lizard men, or provide a convenient method of disposing of unneeded prisoners. Some ships carry larger creatures, such as octopi, squid, or crocodiles.

#### Ship Uses
Pirates and Treasure Hunters.

**Piracy** The chief use of the Wasp is as a pirate vessel, preying on un-armed or lightly-armed ships. It lacks a ram, but the forward deck makes an excellent boarding platform. The Wasp's size even allows it to land on larger ships.

**Free Adventuring** Many adventurers use the Wasp because it is easily purchased or captured from the lizard men. Despite its size, the Wasp is an impressive-looking ship when it comes to awing untraveled locals.

#### Other Configurations
<br>

**Bee Class** This variant is a purely deep space craft used in areas where lizard men have an established off-planet base. The wasp's landing gear is removed and replaced with two additional turrets containing 2 more heavy ballistas. The Bee Class Wasp cannot land on land, although water landings are possible (if uncommon), and the ship's cargo capacity is reduced to 3 tons (removing the landing gear somewhat mitigates the reduction in cargo capacity that would usually be needed as a result of the additional weapons).

**Bumble Bee** This configuration is a massive variant of the Bee in which the legs and the ballista are jettisoned, and the hull itself deepened and widened to carry an additional 6 tons of cargo capacity. The "pregnant" appearance of the Bumble Bee marks it as a trader's vessel and an easy target. In some regions Bee Class Wasps will be disguised as Bumble Bees (either by magic or false fronts) to attract would-be targets.

**Fleet-Footed Wasp** This evasion-minded variant of the Wasp is stripped, reducing AR to 8, but increasing MC to C. In addition, a medium jettison is added in the tail section, taking up 2 tons of cargo space.

### Dragonship
Most groundling nations give little thought to the empires that battle in space above their heads, if they are even aware of them. There is the occasional upstart nation or magocracy that turns its attention to the stars, but these efforts are usually short-lived since internal pressures do them in, or they find themselves unable to compete with other spacefaring nations. As a result, major efforts to reach space are usually only achieved by worlds with a single ruler. One of the exceptions to this general rule is the so-called "oriental" lands of the world of Toril, particularly the nations of Shou Lung and Wa. Based in an area with large populations, and long-lived ruling organizations with efficient bureaucracies, the eastern nations of Toril have dabbled with space travel.

Shou Lung's approach to space exploration is fairly typical of the oriental nations throughout known space. While "western" nations are unaware of space travel, dismiss it, or turn their attentions to more militaristic ends, the oriental nation pushes its experimentation with space forward. The Dragonship of Shou Lung is an example of such experimentation, and reflects the mindset of an organized groundling nation reaching into space.

The Dragonship is boatish, and has some disadvantages over ship designs used by other spacefarers, but it performs significantly better than converted groundling ships, and can be easily constructed by shipwrights who only have experience with building groundling ships (particularly if the shipwrights have experience with building Junks and similar vessels). The helm of this ship is located belowdecks in the rear, with overhead domes allowing a view of space. The large structure on deck is a shrine to the crew's venerated gods and ancestors, to the Path and the Way, and to the emperor, by whose hand the mission is set into effect.

Not one Shou native in 10,000 knows of the Dragonships, as their numbers and missions are for the ears of the emperor only. Dragonship captains all swear to come and go in secret. Despite this, some other nations have discovered the existence of Dragonships. These nations have either stolen ships, or created their own so that they can contest the Shou in the new arena of space. Conversely, some other oriental nations throughout the spheres have adopted the Dragonship design after encountering Shou vessels, since the ship suits their needs and temperament for the same reason that it suits the Shou.

#### Crew
A typical Shou Dragonship has both a captain and a helmsman, but arguably the most important post on a Shou ship belongs to the recorder. The recorder's task is to keep notes on all encounters, collect specimens and trophies, and to act as the official diplomat from Shou Lung. To that end, each recorder is given a number of blank scrolls of official greeting from the emperor. The recorder is empowered to fill in the name of the appropriate race or nation and present them. The crew chosen to man a Shou Dragonship are single men used to long voyages. They are armed with repeating crossbows, a groundling invention that has found great favour in space, making Shou crews both respected and feared.

#### Ship Uses
**Exploration** The chief mission of a Shou Dragonship is to seek out the unusual, the odd, and the new, and bring it back to the spiritual center of the universe (the emperor's palace in Shou Lung). Many wonders from the spheres have been brought back to Shou Lung in this manner. The presence of other spelljamming races intrigues the Shou, and they are particularly interested in accumulating more spelljammer helms. The ultimate goal - according to the bureaucrats on the missions - is to make the celestial bureaucracy truly celestial. There have been several waves of Shou Dragonships commissioned and set loose among the stars, as the "scholars of the stars" fall into and out of favour with the court. There is currently a lull in interest in the stars in Shou Lung, but with the return of new ships with rich treasures and the rising interest of other lords, it is only a matter of time before a new wave of Dragonships sails the spheres.

\page

**Colonization** When exploring Dragonships find locations that would make particularly profitable colonies, once they return home they are usually outfitted to return and set up just such a colony. A Dragonship on a colonization mission will have its cargo bay packed full of everything that the new colony will need to become self-sufficient as soon as possible, and will carry as many as 100 colonists in addition to its regular crew. The ship becomes incredibly cramped and uncomfortable, and the air envelope must usually be refreshed on a regular basis through spells such as Fog Cloud. Depending on the size of the colony to be created, additional colony ships may or may not be sent.

**Free Adventuring** A large number of captains and recorders exposed to the marvels of arcane space suddenly wonder why they would throw in with some small-time emperor when there are whole worlds out there to be discovered, or even conquered. The result is a large number of dragonships no longer loyal to the emperor, cruising around the spheres, taking what they need. Such ships end up in the hands of adventurers, merchants, pirates, and other "free agents" of space. These ships reflect their owners' needs - added armour or increased maneuverability, more weapons (typically up to 3 more large weapons, but even more are not unheard of), and alternate power sources. Most Dragonships used by nations other than Shou Lung are the result of disloyal captains who have been paid by these other nations to allow them to examine and copy their ships (the rest are simply Dragonships that have been captured, or new Dragonships based on those that have been captured).

#### Other Configurations
<br>

**Flaming Dragons** The Shou who take to space in Dragonships (especially those who have turned freebooter) have a love for bombards and greek fire projectors matched only by that of the lizard men and giff. Such destructive weapons appeal greatly to these newcomers to space, and often all of the weapons on board are of this type, with a significant amount of cargo space taken up by shot and shell. As a result of this dangerous tendency, there are significantly fewer Dragonships in space than there might be if their captains favoured carrying safer weapons. Another result, however, is that Dragonships tend to be approached cautiously; if a Dragonship proves to be a Flaming Dragon it may be dangerous to itself, but it is also dangerous to any other ship that comes too close.

**Battle Dragon** This version of the Dragonship was developed in response to the perceived threat of the Wa Tsunami (although it should be noted that the Battle Dragon is fairly poorly suited to defend itself from the tactics of the massive Tsunamis and their swarms of Locusts - luckily for the Shou the Tsunamis have had their attention largely focused on the Armadas of the elves). A Battle Dragon has the dragon-head prow rebuilt and strengthened to the point where it can be used as a piercing ram - the hull and keel of the ship require surprisingly little modification to allow the ship to hold up to the rigours of ramming. In addition, the hull is thickened and braced internally to provide better protection. The weaponry of the Battle Dragon has been significantly upgraded, with a greek fire projector mounted in a protected turret on the scout's deck, and a pair of turreted medium catapults on the drill deck. Often the medium ballistas at the fore of the temple deck will be replaced with bombards. The resulting craft has AR 4, but has a reduced cargo capacity of only 8 tons. The few Battle Dragons that have been built stay grounded in case they must be called upon to defend Shou Lung.


\page

### Nautiloid

The Nautiloid is the standard ship of the line of the various illithid nations, and reflects the nature of the race. Its coiled shell provides the comfort of enclosed spaces while protecting the mind flayers from the irritating rays of the sun.

#### Crew

A standard mind flayer crew numbers 10 illithids, plus 2-5 additional mind flayers, depending on the number of series helms in use. The number of helms determines the SR of the ship. A mind flayer ship has a single captain and first officer, with the remainder of the illithids on board being crew. A Nautiloid will also typically carry between 12 and 20 slaves, which will usually be humans, dwarves, elves, or other demihumans. The illithids prefer to use expendable slaves to man the weapons, while the mind flayers remain safely within the ship's armoured shell. The slaves are also used as boarders in combat (backed up by illithid mind blasts), and as rations on long voyages, so the rate of attrition amongst them is high.

The captain oversees the ship from the command station, while the first officer is usually stationed near the catapult on the battle deck. Since the battle deck is the most likely place for any enemy boarders to attack the ship, it is a dangerous location, so the first officer's position is not envied. As a result, the first officer is usually conspiring to take the place of the captain. No position is completely safe on a mind flayer ship, however, since assassination is a relatively common form of illithid advancement.

#### Ship Uses

**Piracy** Nautiloid pirates are relatively common, and use the configuration and crewing given above. Nautiloid pirates are always looking to replenish their stock of slaves, as well as take anything that isn't nailed down from other ships. Typical tactics involve firing off a salvo from the weapons before ramming and boarding, using mind blasts and other mental powers to incapacitate as many enemy crew as possible, while the slaves fight those enemies who are still able to fight back. Since it is not obvious at first glance if a given Nautiloid is a pirate or a trader, most other races attempt to avoid Nautiloids wherever possible, although in some areas of space they are attacked on sight (most organizations put up with them, however, since illithid traders often form a significant part of the economy).

**Trader** As the workhorse of the illithid fleets, many Nautiloids are used as trade ships. Nautiloid traders appear identical to Nautiloid pirates or military ships, but will typically carry a skeleton crew of 2-5 mind flyers to man the helms, the captain and first officer, along with 6-10 slaves to help with handling the ship. Nautiloid traders will attempt to avoid a fight where possible.

**Military** Nautiloids also form the backbone of illithid navies, and, for their size, are one of the best combat vessels in space. Nautiloids serve equally well as pure combat ships, patrol vessels, and as light troop transports. Light combat duty is usually handled by the smaller illithid Lance. Since the introduction of the pool helm, the larger Dreadnought has begun to replace the Nautiloid as a heavy warship, but the Nautiloid is sure to remain the most common illithid military ship for years.

<br>

#### Other Configurations

**Added Armour** Some illithid captains, obsessed with staying well-protected within their Nautiloid shells, further armour their craft. This will typically take the form of armour plating (often bone or ivory, although metal is not uncommon), as well as thickening the hull and adding extra internal bracing. The result is a ship with AR 2, but with MC E and only 13 tons of cargo space. These ships are often used primarily for combat rather than as traders, and it is not uncommon for them to carry extra weaponry, usually a fourth ballista and a second catapult, further reducing cargo space to 9 tons. These ships are clumsy, but deadly, and should be avoided where possible.

**Added Speed** A common option for Nauiloid traders, this stripped-down version sacrifices armour for extra maneuverability. The MC of the ship is C, but the AR is reduced to 6. These ships will always either have a series helm with 5 mind flayers, or, where possible, will have a pool helm. In either case, the SR is an impressive 5 which, combined with the relatively good maneuverability, usually allows the ship to evade any enemies. Since these ships will typically operate with a skeleton crew, leaving no spare crew to serve as weaponeers, the weapons are often stripped, with the exception of the jettison, giving the trader extra cargo capacity.

### Dragonfly
The Dragonfly, along with the Tradesman, is one of the workhorses of space. Its size and maneuverability make it ideal for transporting small groups, important persons, and small packages. These features also make the Dragonfly an ideal ship for smuggling and exploration.

The Dragonfly is also a good choice for a wizard's ship. A mage can load a significant number of supplies on board and turn the Dragonfly into a mobile laboratory and workshop, placing himself literally millions of miles from nowhere. There he can work in relative peace. A large number of Dragonfly hulks found in various systems were once used for this purpose, abandoned when their masters moved on or died as a result of their experiments.

#### Crew
The Dragonfly is capable of being handled by a single man, although the maneuverability of the craft suffers greatly, and it is better operated with a three-man crew. The captain is usually also the quartermaster and navigator, while the first officer is usually also the helmsman. Other positions are filled as needed by whatever crew is available. The crew of a wizard's ship is usually made up of the wizard owner, along with a small number of trusted servants, which are frequently magical in nature (golems and other constructs are popular, as are undead and sometimes summoned creatures).

#### Ship Uses
**Smuggling** The "light package" trade is a favorable one for spacefarers. Those who wish to send items such as magical tomes, artifacts, magical items, or other valuables to other planets or spheres without passing through the various planes of existence find black market traders very helpful. Smuggling ships are often stripped down for maneuverability and powered by a high-level wizard for speed. The stripped-down Dragonfly has MC B, but its AR is reduced to a very fragile 10.

**Free Adventuring** The Dragonfly is an ideal small exploration ship for adventurers who are looking to land on a planet, scout around, and leave at will. Although it cannot land on water like the Mosquito, it does have an advantage in this usage over the Mosquito - being slightly larger it can carry larger amounts of treasure away (although it is still too small to carry large objects), and can carry slightly larger parties.

**Wizard's Ship** Such Dragonflies are usually gutted and redesigned from within to suit the needs of the wizard. Wizards who do not frequently venture into the phlogiston will often create extradimensional spaces aboard their ships to provide extra storage space. A wizard's ship will often carry no large weapons, as the wizard himself is usually the most dangerous weapon on board.

**Ship's Boat** A Dragonfly may be stripped of its helm in favour of a more conventional power source, and used as a "ship's boat" by a larger vessel (although the Mosquito is usually considered a better choice for this function). Sometimes such a ship will retain its helm and will also serve as a scout and light fighter.

#### Other Configurations

**Firefly** This version of the Dragonfly is used in desperate naval actions. The Firefly is nothing more than a large bomb, as the ship will be armed with either a bombard or greek fire projector and packed to the gills with ammunition and other flammables. The idea is for the ship to be piloted into the heart of an enemy armada and detonated by crashing into a larger ship. The pilot and any crew will sometimes be provided with a lifeboat or dimensional escape device.

**Heavy Dragonfly** Occasionally, more armour is added to the Dragonfly, improving AR to 7, but reducing MC to D. Most individuals seeking a better protected ship will instead look to the second-generation Damselfly craft instead.

**Fighterfly** Some Dragonflies have been used as light combat craft. These ships sacrifice most of their cargo space to mount a total of 4 light weapons (usually catapults), and harass enemy ships at long range. These ships are usually topped-out for increased maneuverability, and will operate in support of larger craft. The Imperial Elven Navy is particularly fond of this configuration, often using it in support of their Armadas and Men-o-War in fleet actions.

### Squid-Ship
The Squid Ship (officially the Cephalopod-class Brig, although even most scholars refer to it by its more common name) is widely considered to be one of the best human ship designs in space. Many scholars believe that the original design for the Squid Ship was created by revolting prisoners of an illithid slave-world, who fused together elements of sea ships and illithid designs. The truth behind this tale is unknown, but it is widely believed. The simplicity of handling which the Squid Ship provides, combined with good armour and weaponry, make it one of the most popular vessels in its size class.

#### Crew
The Squid Ship's simple design allows a relatively small crew to handle the rigging and maneuvering. The captain is usually found on the aft deck, where he gets a good view of the rest of the ship. The helm is located below the captain's station, and communication is often achieved with the use of a simple speaking tube. Typical positions aboard a human Squid Ship include a captain, first officer, helmsman, and navigator. A weaponmaster is often included as well, to command the weapon crews. Lizard man crews tend to include a captain and a shaman for a spelljammer, while other positions will be filled as needed by whomever is available.

#### Ship Uses
**Trader** The bulk of Squid Ships are free traders, privately owned vessels that travel from planet to planet, speculating on goods in an attempt to gain the greatest profit possible. A trader usually has a core crew of 12-20, although captains often hire extra hands when travelling through areas of space where combat is likely.

**Piracy** Squid Ships are a favorite choice for reavers, pirates who roam far from any base, looking for easy plunder. The crew of such a ship will usually number 25-35 men, allowing the Squid Ship to lie in wait for prey ships for a long time. Pirate Squid Ships usually carry at least one spell-caster in addition to the helmsman. This extra spell-user is usually of lower level than the helmsman, and will support the crew in battle (often being placed in dangerous situations).

**Military** The simple design and size of the Squid Ship makes it a common choice for human space navies. The Squid Ship is a good, versatile military ship, able to handle patrol, attack, and defensive duties equally well. Military Squid Ships will often upgrade their ballistas to the heavy variety, and will sometimes carry additional weaponry in the forecastle. When operating close to a base, it is not uncommon for a military Squid Ship to carry extra marines for use in boarding actions.

**Free Adventuring** The size of the Squid Ship, along with its ability to land on water, makes it ideal for adventurers exploring newly-discovered worlds (and bringing back the more profitable parts of them). These versions are often modified for better armour, or for more maneuverability, depending on the temperaments of the users.

#### Other Configurations
**Alternate Ram** Pirates and others preferring boarding actions to ship-to-ship combat often replace the distinctive piercing ram of the Squid Ship with a grappling ram. These vessels usually carry a full complement of marines.

**Lizard Man Incubators** Prior to the introduction of the Bloatfly, lizard men tribes preferred the Squid Ship for use as an incubator for their eggs. Many of these Incubators have yet to be replaced by Bloatflies, and can still be found in close orbit around fire bodies to ensure that the carried eggs are properly warmed, producing stronger, more intelligent offspring. These ships have a flooded cargo deck, in which various plants and algae grow, both to replenish the air envelope and to provide the proper environment for the eggs.

### Tradesman
The standard Tradesman is the most common ship in civilized space, varying little throughout the spheres. It is used by humans, lizard men, elves, dwarves, halflings, goblinkin, gnomes, and even mind flayers (under duress). The Tradesman is a common short-range merchant ship, plying its way between its ports-of-call, and not equipped to deal with much more than a similarly-equipped vessel that has turned pirate. The performance of the Tradesman is mediocre at best, and the only reason it has become such a popular vessel is its simplicity (which allows it to be easily built at many different ports, as well as allowing crews with little or no training to handle it), and the fact that its cargo bays and cavernous steerage deck allow it to carry more cargo than most ships its size.

#### Crew
A typical Tradesman is operated by a singe captain. If the ship is a free trader, the captain is also the owner, however there are collections of guildsmen and combined business interests, called trading costers, who own fleets of Tradesmen. In these trading costers each ship's captain is both partial owner of his ship and of the whole fleet. Trading costers have the advantage of strength through numbers. They can minimize the loss of a particular ship because they have so many. Costers vary from locale to locale, but all Tradesmen owned by a particular coster fly similar colours. Often groups of coster Tradesmen will be encountered, carrying merchandise across space in a caravan - if the profit is high enough. Crew assignments on a Tradesman vary from ship to ship and from race to race. Lizard man ships are arranged along typically slapdash lines, while elven ships adhere to a strict chain of command that (to human minds) often borders on the effete and ludicrous. Humans make do with a captain, helmsman, first officer, and pilot, with other positions filled as needed.

#### Ship Uses
**Trading** The vast majority of Tradesmen are used as traders, keeping asteroid-based civilizations supplied, transporting bulk valuables, and even transporting passengers. Most Tradesmen operate on a single trade route over and over, typically staying within a single sphere.

**Free Adventuring** The Tradesman is often the first spelljamming ship for bands of adventurers, although this is more because of the fact that it is common and readily available rather than because of any suitability for the task. Adventurers who are successful usually upgrade to a more suitable ship as soon as possible. The chain of command aboard an adventuring ship usually sops after captain - which in adventuring terms usually means "the one who yells the loudest."

**Piracy** The common nature of the Tradesman also makes it a vessel for pirates new to the trade, again before they "trade up" to a more suitable craft. When using a Tradesman the pirate's best targets are other Tradesmen and groundling ships. The only advantage that a pirate Tradesman has is that most potential targets would not consider a Tradesman to be a threat, and will not expect an attack.

#### Other Configurations
**Light Cruiser** A Tradesman variant preferred by pirates and those plagued by pirates, the Light Cruiser is plated, increasing AR to 4, but reducing MC to E. Tradesman Light Cruisers typically carry 3 medium ballistas or catapults, reducing cargo capacity to 15 tons.

### Galleon
Not designed for use in space, the Galleon is the best of the craft used by groundlings who first discover space travel and acquire a spelljamming helm. While more suitable for space travel than other groundling ships, the Galleon suffers from some of the same drawbacks as most groundling ships taken into space, but to a lesser extent. The Galleon has poor maneuverability and armour, although it can comfortably carry more than enough men to fully crew it while in space, and it carries what is generally considered to be adequate weaponry.

#### Crew
When used as a spelljamming vessel, the number of crew required to operate the Galleon is significantly lower than the crew required to operate it as a sailing ship. Whereas a seafaring Galleon will usually have a crew of about 130 men, and may even carry as many as 500 men including passengers, a Galleon which carries this number of men into space will quickly foul its air envelope. Most spelljamming Galleons carry a full crew of 30 men, sufficient to handle the ship and its weaponry, while allowing some spare crew to help out as needed.

#### Ship Uses
**Trader** Galleons make adequate trading vessels in space, and are the ships of choice for many of the more thoughtful groundling nations which dabble in spelljamming. While the Galleon does not perform as well in space as ships specifically designed for spelljamming, it is nevertheless an adequate ship, and has the advantage that it can easily trade with groundling nations without attracting much attention. The cargo holds of the Galleon are large enough that the ship can carry a significant amount of trade goods to and from foreign worlds. Most Galleons in space remain on well-travelled trade routes within a single sphere, where their chances of running into trouble are relatively low.

**Explorer** Some groundling nations use a handful of Galleons as exploration vessels. These ships will generally be royally chartered, and are expected to explore and bring back wonders and riches from the cosmos, as well as tales that will enhance the prestige of the royal house. Because each Galleon represents a significant investment, and its safe return is so important, the ship will usually be manned by the best and brightest heroes that the country can gather together. As a result, pirates attacking a royal explorer often find that once they attempt to board the ship, they are badly outclassed by the Galleon's crew.

#### Other Configurations
**Gunship** Some of the more technologically advanced groundling nations prefer this version of the Galleon, which they use primarily as a vessel of war. In this configuration the ballistas and catapult are stripped out. In their place the Gunship mounts an impressive 10 bombards, two in the forecastle (one is able to fire forward or to port, while the other can fire forward or to starboard), two in the stern castle (one able to fire aft or to port, and the other able to fire aft or to starboard), and six on the main deck (three facing port, and three facing starboard). Cargo space on the Gunship shrinks to a mere 5 tons. These ships require a full 50 men to operate the ship and her weaponry at peak efficiency, but usually carry about twice that. Gunship Galleons are short-range craft, but are feared in the spheres in which they are known, since they can deliver a truly devastating broadside. The giff are particularly impressed by this configuration of the Galleon. The Gunship Galleon design has led to the recent development of the Clipper vessel by an advanced groundling culture using giff mercenaries.

### Octopus
A large ship reminiscent of the earthly cephalopod of the same name, the Octopus moves through the void in a manner similar to those creatures, its bulbous end first, trailing its armed tentacles. Originally designed as a convoy protector during the first Unhuman War, its weapon layout earned it the nickname "tailgunner" (although its turreted weapons actually have an excellent all-around field of fire).

The Octopus was the result of an unlikely alliance between a group of neutral humans and illithids. The resulting hybrid has many illithid design features, but was intended to be piloted by human mages, and crewed by a combination of humans and a few mind flayers.

#### Crew
During the first Unhuman War, the typical crew of an Octopus included 2-3 human spelljamming mages, a single captain (who might be human or illithid depending on the individual vessel), and 4-10 officers, about half of whom would usually be mind flayers. The remainder of the crew would be made up of normal humans. The total number of crew aboard such a ship was usually 40-45, which provided enough hands to operate the ship at full capacity, and man all of the weapons, while still providing a squad of marines for protection in the unlikely event that the Octopus was boarded. More frequently, these marines would be used as extra hands to replace any combat losses aboard either the Octopus or the ship(s) it was protecting. In modern times, the crew of an Octopus is typically made up of human pirates, and will usually number around 45-60 reavers. The organization of pirate crews varies greatly, while those vessels in the hands of adventurers have crews which vary even more greatly.

#### Ship Uses
**Convoy Escort** The Octopus was intended to guard convoys, and some of the ships are still used as escorts to this day in dangerous areas of space. During the first Unhuman Wars these ships proved their worth, since they were powerful and versatile. After the defeat of the goblinkin, the need for large groups of ships travelling in convoys for protection diminished, and the human/illithid alliance which created these ships quickly broke up. Most of these ships were retired at that time, and their equipment salvaged for use on smaller, more maneuverable vessels. Recently, however, an enterprising illithid discovered a forgotten depot with a number of Octopus ships. These ships have been refitted, and sold off to anyone who could afford them, and the ship has begun to ply the spacelanes again. In the current political climate in the spheres, the Octopus is once again useful, and new versions of the ship are being built at several shipyards.

**Piracy** The majority of Octopus ships in modern times seem to have found their way into the hands of pirates. Such vessels tend to pound their targets into submission before boarding, rather than simply grappling at the earliest opportunity, but this may vary based upon the temperament of the pirates. The appeal of this vessel to pirates can be linked to her good cargo capacity, her good maneuverability for a ship her size, and her ability to operate with a low crew, thus allowing most pirates on board to either man the weapons, or serve as marines. Because so many of these rare ships are used by pirates and privateers, a strange Octopus is best approached cautiously.

#### Other Configurations
**Illithid Octopus** A small number of these craft have been sold to mind flayer houses, and refitted with pool helms. These ships are usually plated with additional armour, increasing AR to 6, but dropping MC to E. Since only the most powerful illithid houses can afford the pool helms which these ships use, an Octopus is seen as a status symbol. Unlike the even more expensive Dreadnought, an Illithid Octopus is usually used as a private yacht by very powerful mind flayers, and as such is usually richly appointed.

**Heavy Frigate** Several of these ships have been modified to serve as heavy frigates. These ships have their bowsprits replaced with piercing rams, and have their hulls thickened and reinforced to withstand the stresses of ramming. The bridge is relocated to the crow's deck, while the former bridge becomes a muster area for boarding troops. In addition, the forward half of the steerage deck is transformed into a gunnery deck, mounting 2-4 medium ballistas behind hatches replacing the fore portals. The Heavy Frigate is AR 6, and has 20-24 tons of cargo, depending on the number of medium ballistas carried.

### Smalljammer
Smalljammers are miniature versions of the legendary Spelljammer itself. They retain the basic manta shape with the upswept tail, but where the citadels would be on the larger craft, Smalljammers have an enclosed cabin for crew. Instead of a landing platform, the bow quarters have a small outer deck as well as the command deck. While this is the Smalljammer's true appearance, very few see the ship as such from the outside world. A Smalljammer can project an illusion around itself, usually of an asteroid, space creature, or some type of ship, up to a maximum size of 50 tons. The illusion is perfect and undetectable until the atmospheric envelope is breached. The Smalljammer does not gain the abilities of the ship it imitates, however, which can lead to clues that all is not as it seems (for example, it would make a surprisingly maneuverable Galleon).

A Smalljammer without a captain can move under its own power at SR 2, but it is unable to reach spelljamming speeds. The only exception to this is on the Smalljammer's initial flight when it is "birthed" by the Spelljammer. At this time all of the Smalljammers travel at spelljamming speeds through the phlogiston until each of them reaches a crystal sphere. At that point the Smalljammer enters wildspace, and drops to tactical speeds. Like the Spelljammer, Smalljammers have the innate ability to open portals in crystal spheres, but these portals do not remain permanently open. Smalljammers can only be powered by major or minor helms (and derivative helms such as crowns of the stars), or by an ultimate helm. Any attempt to power a Smalljammer with a different helm type, such as a pool helm, series helm, orbus, or other variant, will fail. A lifejammer or death helm will function, but will ultimately kill the ship. If such a life-draining helm is used, the Smalljammer must save vs. lightning once a day. Failure will kill the ship, turning it into a lifeless hulk that will decay in 1-10 days. It will still be usable as a ship until the end of that time, at which point it will break up. A captain with an ultimate helm will be able to power the Smalljammer as if the ultimate helm were a crown of the stars, except that the SR will be calculated as if it were a major helm.

#### Crew
A Smalljammer without a crew will make every attempt to remain hidden and inconspicuous. When in this state, the first person to board the Smalljammer and attempt to pilot it with an appropriate helm will bond with the ship. This person becomes the Smalljammer's captain, and enjoys an empathic link with the ship. This is similar to the relationship between the Spelljammer and its captain. The Smalljammer is like a child compared to the larger Spelljammer, and so it reacts more strongly and instinctively than the larger ship. If the captain acts in a fashion which the Smalljammer does not approve of (primarily actions which place the ship in danger), the helmsman must save vs. spells or suffer intense pain and take 1d6 points of damage. In addition, in dangerous situations the helmsman must make a save vs. spells or the Smalljammer will immediately flee at top speed for 1-6 turns.

The Smalljammer only recognizes one helmsman, and any others who attempt to pilot it will be repulsed, being forced to save vs. spells or take 1d6 points of damage. This captain is the only helmsman that the Smalljammer will recognize until the death of the ship or the captain, or until the Smalljammer rejects the captain. Each time the captain performs an action that causes the Smalljammer to rebel, the captain must make a second save, this time vs. staves, or the Smalljammer will reject him. A rejected captain will lose his bond with the ship, and will be repulsed in the same manner as described above if he attempts to pilot the ship again. The next person to attempt to pilot the craft will become the new captain. Things which cause a Smalljammer to rebel include leaving it alone for extended periods of time, crowding it with other ships or potentially hostile individuals, inflicting damage on its hull or interior, and exposing it to frequent danger. The Smalljammer cannot keep a captain from leaving the ship, but it does maintain its psychic bond to a range of 10 miles, and will call for the helmsman to return. The Smalljammer is responsive to its captain, and will form internal walls, doorways, and furnishings from its living hull according to the needs of the captain.

The strong bond between a Smalljammer and its captain, along with the extremely cautious nature of the ship, tends to result in extremely small crews. In fact, the crew will usually just be the captain, although it is not uncommon for a few of the captain's closest companions to be aboard as well. In any case, a crew of more than 10 is virtually unheard of. In any case, since a large portion of the Smalljammer's bulk is unusable as living space, a large crew would find the ship extremely cramped.

#### Ship Uses
**Lone-Wolf** The nature of the Smalljammer lends itself well to solitary pursuits, such as exploring distant reaches of the flow, engaging in research away from any distractions, and other such activities. Most captains quickly adapt to the Smalljammer's desire to stay in deep space, away from the potential threats that can be found in the busier spacelanes. Those that do not tend to find themselves being rejected.

#### Other Configurations
The living nature of the Smalljammer makes most modifications impossible without killing the craft. While the ship can carry light catapults or ballistas, any larger weapons will be rejected by the ship, which will simply retract its leathery supports from the offending weapon (bolting it to the hull would damage the ship), and let it topple overboard. Smalljammers will never carry greek fire or smoke powder, and will react strongly against a captain who attempts to bring weapons aboard which use these volatile substances.

### Great Bombard
One of the few ships designed for the giff (the design was actually made by a human shipwright hired by a group of giff, but the plans have spread to several different giff organizations which have built a number of the craft), the Great Bombard resembles a single-decked groundling bireme, and indeed such a craft actually served as the frame for the first of these ships. The rowing banks are planked over, and the prow is removed and replaced with a huge bombard of cold iron banded with steel rings, which runs half the length of the ship. The bombard is also typically capped with a great brass blunt ram, which is usually ornately sculpted, often in the shape of a giff's head. Great Bombards carry pre-measured tin drums, each of which carries the 20 charges of smoke powder needed to fire a single shot from the great bombard. Any critical hit against a Great Bombard has a 10% chance of igniting the powder stores, inflicting 3d10 x 5 hull points of damage (this is greater than normal because, in addition to the prodigious amounts of smokepowder carried for the main gun, the giff crew will usually be carrying considerable additional powder for their personal weapons).

Although the design is based on a groundling ship, the Great Bombard is badly unbalanced by its main weapon, and when landing in water it will tend to capsize in all but the most calm of waters. As a result, Great Bombards usually dock only at asteroid bases, and stay away from large worlds.

#### Crew
The crew numbers given above are for human-sized crew. Since the Great Bombard was actually designed for use by the giff, it can be handled by only 10 of the large, powerful creatures. The four chief officers aboard a Great Bombard are the respected captain, the noble helmsman, the puissant crafter, and the master gunsman. The master gunsman is responsible for firing the bombard. The puissant crafter is responsible for maintenance of the weapon. The noble helmsman does not actually man the helm (since giff are unable to cast spells, and are thus unable to power standard helms), but instead is in charge of the hired human or other individual operating the helm. The respected captain, of course, gives the order to fire. The remaining giff on board (typically a total of 20 giff are carried) are assistants to the ship's masters, as well as being responsible for the ship's maneuverability, keeping the gun clean, reloading the gun, forming boarding parties, and manning the light ballistas when necessary (although these are considered sissy weapons). The respected captain is the ultimate leader of the giff, but he will almost always be acting on the orders of whomever has hired the giff as mercenaries.

#### Ship Uses
**Mercenary Warship** Virtually all of the two dozen or so Great Bombards which are known to exist serve as mercenary warships, hiring out their services to the highest bidder. The Great Bombard is the giff super-weapon - a mobile platform with a big gun on it, capable of knocking most of its opponents into the next crystal sphere. As the ship is dominated by its gun, so too the captain and crew are dominated by their need to acquire enough smokepowder to fire the great bombard. As a result, Great Bombards must be continually employed as mercenaries in order to afford the huge weapon's ammunition. Great Bombards are usually hired by factions with small or non-existent fleets of their own, as they are often used as intimidation weapons more than anything else. In large fleet actions, the Great Bombard is almost as great a danger to friends as it is to foes. The Great Bombards in known space form a loose brotherhood of giff known as the Cult of the Gun. All captains are members by the very act of possessing the Great Bombard, and one captain will never fire upon another for fear of damaging the weapon.

#### Other Configurations
**Gunship** When possible, and when sufficient smokepowder is available, the giff will replace the light ballistas with typical bombards, mounted on turrets. The giff greatly prefer this version to the standard configuration, but it tends to be impractical due to the scarcity of smokepowder.

### Battle Dolphin
The graceful Battle Dolphin is the latest human ship to appear in any quantity in the void. It combines a number of design features that make it a highly versatile ship. The bulk of the Battle Dolphin is enclosed to protect the crew. While this limits the number of weapons emplacements aboard the Dolphin, most crews consider the protection to be worth it. The Battle Dolphin maintains an upper surveillance level which places it above the decks of opposing ships. Most importantly, the galleonlike portion of the upper deck can separate from the main ship and make planetary landings. This Dolphin Shuttle is designed for handling in space; however it appears to be a small groundling ship. This makes it easy to trade with groundlings without attracting undue attention. While the Dolphin Shuttle is very small, it carries far more cargo than most ships its size, making it very useful for short trading trips.

#### Crew
The crew configuration of a Battle Dolphin depends largely on whether the ship's owner can afford a second helm for the Dolphin Shuttle. If not, then a single major helm is used for both ships, and is mounted on the Shuttle. The Dolphin Shuttle becomes the bridge for the entire ship, and holds the command officers. If two helms are used, the Battle Dolphin bridge and officers are found on the officers' deck, necessitating a second crew for the Dolphin Shuttle. Typically in this configuration the first mate will serve as the commanding officer for the Dolphin Shuttle. The Battle Dolphin can operate with a surprisingly small crew for a ship its size, leaving room for a significant number of passengers or boarding troops, depending on the ship's use. While most Battle Dolphins are operated by human crews, the Imperial Elven Navy has deemed the ship suitable for elven use. Elven crews are arranged along strict military lines, and will always include a second helm for the Dolphin Shuttle.

#### Ship Uses
**Trader** The Battle Dolphin, despite the name, was actually designed to serve as a trade vessel. The main ship can carry large cargos between space ports, while the Dolphin Shuttle allows for easy trade with groundlings. The Battle Dolphin is an unpopular target for pirate attacks, since the ship is capable of defending itself adequately in ship-to-ship combat, and since it frequently carries large numbers of marines. The enclosed nature of the ship makes it impossible for even a sharp-eyed, experienced lookout to guess at how many warriors may be on board.

**Warship** The versatility of the Battle Dolphin has made it a popular addition to many navies. While it is not as hard-hitting as the more common Hammership, it can still be highly effective in battle. Most importantly, a Battle Dolphin serves as an excellent support vessel while still being capable of defending itself, making an escort unnecessary. In a fleet, Battle Dolphins will most frequently serve either as supply ships, or as troop transports. Some military Battle Dolphins use Dolphin Shuttles that have been armed, typically with either a single medium catapult or ballista, in order to provide more versatility in combat. Elven Battle Dolphins usually carry several Flitters in addition to the Dolphin Shuttle, using the rear balcony as a docking area.

**Adventurer's Ship** The versatility of the Battle Dolphin, along with the low crew requirements, makes the vessel popular with adventurers and other small parties. The ability of the Dolphin Shuttle to land on worlds without attracting attention is the primary attraction of this craft, however, since adventurers often have missions which require subtlety. At the same time, the powerful Battle Dolphin in orbit provides the firepower that is needed if subtlety fails. Most adventurers operate Battle Dolphins with fairly small crews, typically made up of the adventuring party itself, along with a few trusted retainers.

#### Other Configurations
**Narwhal** Since the Battle Dolphin is still a new ship, few other configurations have become common (although owners often change the weaponry to suit their needs). The exception to this is the Narwhal. The Narwhal adds a piercing ram attached to the forward bridge, removing the windows in the process. These ships tend to be used solely as warships, and often include extra weaponry. Narwhals can be truly deadly ships, and have quickly gained a dangerous reputation.

### Neogi Mindspider
A new ship which has only appeared within the past 50 or 60 years, the Mindspider has been quickly gaining the same dangerous reputation as the more common neogi Deathspiders, and as a result they are usually attacked on sight by those capable of doing so. The Mindspider is lighter, faster, more maneuverable, and better armoured than the Deathspider, but since it is so much smaller it carries far less weaponry and marines. The Mindspider is used in situations where subtlety, or what passes for subtlety amongst the neogi, is needed.

#### Crew
A Mindspider will typically carry 1-3 neogi, each with a personal umber hulk slave. The remainder of the crew (typically enough to give the Mindspider a full crew of 10) will be made up of lesser slaves placed under charm spells, or other enchantments to make them loyal to their neogi masters. Typical of neogi organization, all crewmembers are considered property of the ship's captain.

#### Ship Uses
**Command Vehicle** Most Mindspiders are used as command ships. This is done in situations where one neogi captain owns more than one Deathspider ship. In these cases the Mindspider will serve as the personal lair of this wealthy neogi. Races unfamiliar with this practice would usually assume that the fleet is led by one of the larger vessels, but in fact the relationship between the Mindspider and the Deathspider is seen by the neogi as being similar to the relationship between the small neogi and their large umber hulk protector/slaves. When a Mindspider is serving as a command ship, the Deathspiders in its fleet will perform any fighting, while the Mindpsider remains at a safe distance.

**Support Vessel** While the Mindspider was at first a very rare craft, in the past 10-15 years they have become much more common (although still not as common as Deathspiders). This has resulted in some very wealthy neogi fleet owners who have come to possess more than one Mindspider. In such a case any Mindspiders other than the personal ship of the Fleet owner (which will be used as a command vehicle) will be used as support vessels for the fleet's Deathspiders, much in the way that lesser neogi are often used in combat in support of their more powerful umber hulk slaves. These Mindspiders are intended to harass the enemy while the Deathspiders do the real fighting. Nevertheless, this is a somewhat risky assignment for the neogi slave-captains of these Mindspiders, since a Mindspider closing into combat is more vulnerable than a Deathspider doing the same. As a result, fleet owners tend to put their most ambitious (and therefore dangerous) slave-lieutenants in command of any Mindspiders acting in a support role.

**Piracy** A few elder neogi will break away from their kin in an attempt to avoid transformation into an old master at their fangs. These neogi, along with a few loyal umber hulk slaves and whatever other slaves they were able to retain, will typically flee from their fellows in a Mindspider. Such a craft becomes very dangerous, since the renegade neogi captain will usually be a total berserker, attacking any ship encountered in order to avoid leaving behind any witnesses who could potentially tell other neogi the location of the captain. These Mindspiders are often modified according to the whims of the increasingly erratic neogi captain.

#### Other Configurations
**Broodship Lander** The neogi are noted for their absence from large planetary bodies. Recently, however, there seems to be a neogi movement to settle larger worlds than their typical asteroid settlements. For these purposes, a Mindspider may be stripped of its helm, weaponry and crew, and let loose from a Deathspider in orbit. Such a Broodship will have its cargo hold loaded with an old master. The ship will then fall to the ground, crashing in the process. At this stage the old master will release the infant neogi, who will domesticate local slaves, and create a new neogi base which can then be used by their spacefaring fellows. The best part of this, from the neogi point of view, is that their own lives, and those of their precious umber hulk slaves, are never put at risk. This is the theory, at least. So far these experiments have failed, but sages are disturbed by this new trend, and believe that it is only a matter of time before the neogi succeed.

### Whaleship
As long as the Hammership, but much taller, with a large number of enclosed decks and a heavy, armoured, blunt ram in the front, the whale looks like the sea mammal it is named after, a huge sperm whale. It is not known for being graceful, only big. It is a perfect hauler of large bulk freight and passengers. Its lack of maneuverability and weaponry generally makes it ineffective as a combat craft, but Whales have been used in that capacity in the past. Their greatest advantage is that all of their considerable tonnage is enclosed.

#### Crew
In addition to the helmsman and captain, the crew of a Whale consists of oarsmen who man the ship's flippers. Those Whales used as passenger ships usually have these crewmen serving double duty as pursers, cooks, and servants to those on board. It is rare for the crew of a Whale to number more than 20-25, since this allows a large number of passengers to be carried. Even Whales being used as pure cargo haulers will not usually carry more than this minimal crew. Standard liners will usually be equipped to carry 60-80 passengers, while Whales used as troop transports will be outfitted to carry 100-400 troops.

#### Ship Uses
**Passenger Liner** The Whale was designed as a large hauler, and it performs extremely well when the cargo that it is hauling is passengers. The quality of these liners is usually fairly high, since it is an expensive ship to begin with, so most owners tend not to scrimp too much on amenities. Most Whales used as liners are roughly equivalent in comfort to an above-average inn, but some have become famous for their shear opulence. The most luxurious of these liners tend to carry only 20-40 passengers, but charge 10-20 times what most luxury services would charge. Those few Whale liners which do not pay much attention to comfort tend to be cut-rate vessels which cram as many passengers aboard as possible. There are a number of different firms using Whales as liners throughout the known spheres, ranging from one-ship operations to massive lines. One of the most successful is the Pandros Line out of Theiaspace, which is run by a female halfling named Calia Thornbow. Others include Brilliant Night Tours, Fraldathiagn Haulers, and Meer, Dostrol, Hampstad, and Klatchkapper, Ltd.

**Bulk Hauler** Almost as frequently as they are used as passenger liners, Whales can be found serving as bulk cargo haulers. These large ships are one of the few economical ways of transporting quantities of low-value goods, such as grain, cloth, or timber, and those with powerful enough helms will frequently tow one or more cargo barges for further economy. Most Whales used as bulk haulers will have regular shipping runs, often supplying asteroid bases and cities with needed goods on a contract. A Whale being used as a speculative free trader is virtually unheard of. A Whale bulk hauler will frequently carry passengers for a minimal fee, but unlike their liner brethren, they tend to offer no amenities for the passengers beyond a berth. Often such passengers will be expected to supply their own food and drink.

**Military Support** A significant number of military organizations use Whales as heavy support craft, typically hauling large numbers of troops and supplies simultaneously. These ships are spartan and utilitarian, and are most commonly seen in invasion fleets. Since a Whale used in this role will typically be carrying 2-4 times as many men as its air envelope can safely support, magical means of refreshing the air envelope are highly recommended for all but the shortest of voyages (Fog Cloud spells are the most commonly-used method). Even when used as a military vessel, a Whale usually stays out of combat, since it carries little weaponry. Sometimes, however, a Whale will be used to break up enemy formations by simply ramming the largest enemy craft, allowing allied combat ships to mop up the other enemy ships. Since a Whale is able to simply plow through most small and medium ships, as well as cause massive damage to larger ships, this can be an effective tactic.

**Illithid Crew** In areas in which standard mind flayer ships tend to be attacked on sight, the Whale has become a popular ship for the illithids. The enclosed vessel appeals to illithid sensibilities, although its lack of weaponry tends to limit it to peaceful applications. Such ships will be powered by a pool helm, and will typically operate in such a manner that passers-by will never realize that the Whale is not manned by humans.

#### Other Configurations
**Killer Whale** In this version of the Whale, large portions of the observation deck are cut away to transform it into a weapons deck. While this section of the ship then becomes vulnerable to attack (reduce AR to 6), this allows as many as a dozen large weapons to be mounted, typically a mix of medium and heavy ballistas and catapults. The cargo space of a Killer Whale is reduced depending on what weapons are carried. As yet the Killer Whale is an uncommon, but deadly warship. There are rumours that a pirate Killer Whale exists, operated by a mixed crew of humans and illusionist gnomes. This ship uses illusions of solid walls to make it appear as a standard Whale until it attacks its unsuspecting victims. The crew of this ship seems to have a great hatred for tinker gnomes, and attacks them in preference to other targets.

**Glass Whale** This variant on the Whale is simply an opulent liner in which the heavily armoured bow has been made clear using Glassteel spells to provide a "window on wildspace" for the passengers. The Arnazdo Operation (Milo Arnazdo, proprietor) uses Glass Whales as the symbol of their passenger service, and backs up the fragile-looking (but actually very sturdy) ships by stationing powerful wizards on board.

### Gnomish Whelk
The Whelk is a grown ship, much like the elven Flitters and Armadas. In fact, the Whelk was developed by forest gnomes working with elven shipwrights, and using modified versions of the spells used by the elves to grow their ships. Whelks appear as spiraled sea shells dotted by sharp spikes along the whorls, traveling large-end first through the void. The graceful design of the Whelk is in sharp contrast to most gnomish designs, which tend to be hodgepodges of different ships and naval architectural styles, as if the designer was changing his mind as he built it (an impression which is often accurate). This is because the Whelk is not built by the tinker gnomes familiar to spacefarers, but is instead built by the more reclusive forest gnomes, specifically illusionist forest gnomes who enjoy a loose alliance with the Imperial Elven Navy.

#### Crew
The Whelk is designed specifically for gnomes, and no allowance has been made for larger crew or passengers - the quarters and passageways are gnome-sized and larger creatures must make do or sleep on the outer deck. A Whelk will occasionally carry one or more elven passengers, but this is rare, and the elves usually find this uncomfortable unless they are particularly short. The crew requirements listed above are the theoretical minimum and maximum for human-sized crew. A crew of gnome-sized creatures has a crew of 30/60.

The command staff of a Whelk is entirely made up of gnome illusionists - captain, helmsman, chief mage, and weapons officer - of levels 2-12. In addition there will be 1-4 additional illusionists of levels 1-6 amongst the crew. The rest of the crew (typically a total of about 40 gnomes will be on board) is made up of gnome warriors of levels 0-3. The command staff and other illusionists use their spells to increase the apparent dangerous nature of the ship (large monsters on deck, additional weaponry, etc.). Those of sufficient level may use Hallucinatory Terrain to mask the appearance of the ship, making it appear as a star field (although movement spoils this illusion). In addition to the crew, the Whelk will be home to either a family of normal badgers, or 1-2 giant badgers, who are used as watchdogs and pets.

#### Ship Uses
**Explorer** The original intended use of the Whelk was to serve as an exploration vessel, with the intent that the gnomish crews would coordinate their exploratory efforts with those of their elven friends on other ships. The Whelk's size (big enough to carry sufficient explorers and equipment for long voyages, but small enough to avoid too much attention) and ability to land on land or water make it ideal for this application, especially when combined with the abilities of the crew to camouflage themselves from any natives when necessary.

**Warship** Although armed sufficiently to defend itself from casual attack, the Whelk is not truly designed for combat. Despite this, when the second Unhuman War erupted many Whelk captains came to the aid of the elves. The Whelks have proved surprisingly effective against the goblinkin, although this has been primarily due to the magical abilities of the crews rather than any innate combat-worthiness of the ship. Whelks using straightforward combat tactics against the goblinkin were quickly overwhelmed, and their crews slaughtered. Those who took full advantage of their crews' abilities to misdirect and confuse their enemies, on the other hand, proved to be invaluable, especially when used in concert with other ships. An unsupported Whelk is nowhere near as competent in combat, but is an excellent scout/spy craft. The success of these Whelks has led some gnomish captains to turn mercenary, hiring their ships out to the highest bidder.

#### Other Configurations
**Warrior** This version of the Whelk is favoured by experienced veterans of many battles. Portions of the Warrior's shell are cut away in strategic locations to allow for better maneuverability, and to allow extra firing ports for large weapons. The portions of the hull are retained, and left in place most of the time (in this configuration the Warrior performs identically to a standard Whelk), but they can be removed and stowed prior to dangerous missions. When this is done, the ship's AR is reduced to 8, but maneuverability rises to C, and five ballistas are revealed. Usually this will come as a complete surprise to the Warrior's enemies, since the missing hull sections will typically be concealed with illusions. The ballistas used are usually light ballistas, but several ships have been known to carry medium ballistas, although this reduces cargo capacity to a mere 5 tons.

### Neogi Deathspider
One of the largest of the standard ships of space, the all-too-common Deathspider is the pride and joy of the neogi. Its large size and distinctive shape make the Deathspider easily recognizable in space. As a result, it is usually attacked (or avoided if possible) on sight. The neogi Deathspider is divided into the command section and the cargo pits. The command section is in the forward portion of the vessel and contains the bridge, the helm, and the quarters and possessions of the most important neogi aboard. The larger "abdomen" of the craft is used as weapons platform, cargo space, and slaves' quarters (including the quarters of the lesser neogi). The top half of the abdomen can slide back to reveal a small citadel perched on the lower haunches. This structure is normally revealed only in battle situations, since the Deathspider's weapons are located there. The forward weapons pit of the citadel deck is also the source of boarding parties when the grappling ram captures an enemy ship.

#### Crew
A typical Deathspider will carry 8 neogi, each of whom has a personal umber hulk slave. Additional slaves, umber hulk and otherwise, make up the remainder of the standard 30-man crew, as well as the weapons crews. In total, a Deathdpider will usually carry about 60 or 70 crew, made up of 8 neogi, and 10-16 umber hulks, with the remainder of the crew being humanoid slaves of various races, with humans being the most common. It should be noted that for air considerations a neogi uses half the air of a man-sized creature, while an umber hulk uses twice as much. The result is that a crew of 60 will use about as much air as 66-72 normal men, depending on the number of umber hulks aboard. The most important neogi aboard will be the captain-owner, who will usually also have some spelllcasting ability. The spelljammer is the second-most powerful neogi on the Deathspider (although he is still considered to be a slave of the captain) and will typically be a 6th-8th level mage. The rest of the neogi are lowly slaves, but they can aspire to gain more slaves of their own, and may even become ship owners one day, holding other neogi in their thrall. The non-neogi slaves have no such hope. Should the captain of a Deathspider be slain, the remaining neogi will vote on a new captain. Politicking is intense in these elections, and the neogi with the most powerful umber hulk servant will usually be the winner. In boarding actions the personal umber hulk slaves of the lesser neogi are used as shock troops, supported by the humanoid slaves, and sometimes the lesser neogi as well. Since all creatures in the universe are seen as either slaves or potential slaves, boarding actions are extremely common in order to capture more slaves.

#### Ship Uses
**Neogi Workhorse** The Deathspider is the most common neogi craft, and serves as a cargo hauler, battle wagon, discovery ship, and slave trader. Since all Deathspiders tend to look identical regardless of their function, it is not easy to determine if a given Deathspider is fitted for exploring, or actively hunting for slaves. As a result, all Deathspiders are usually either attacked or evaded, whichever the defending ship is most capable of doing.

**Broodship** Those neogi fortunate enough to reach the end of their natural lifespans become Great Old Masters. These old neogi grow to prodigious sizes, and must consume massive amounts of flesh, preferably live, in order to nourish the young neogi growing within their distended abdomens. When this occurs, the Deathspider carrying the Great Old Master is temporarily transformed into a broodship. The cargo pits are cleared to make room for the Great Old Master, and a pen is built for it, with a protective dome so that the abdomen dome can still be retracted when weapons need to be deployed. A broodship is driven by the hunger of the Great Old Master, and will usually attack any ship it encounters in order to provide live food.

**Carrier** Some Deathspiders use the additional cargo area of the flight deck to carry a number of small Urchin craft, which can then be used in combat. As many as 20 Urchins may be carried by a Deathspider, and as battles with elven Armadas have destroyed more and more Deathspiders, the use of Urchins to counter the elven Flitters has beome more and more common.

#### Other Configurations
**Hulks** Deathspider hulks are available for sale from the neogi, but since they are not the best ships to be seen in, they are not a popular seller. Those few purchasers who do end up with a Deathspider hulk on their hands tend to strip the ship, removing the legs and sails, while pulling back the dome, or removing it entirely. The hulk is then usually used as an orbiting weapons platform to defend an asteroid base.

**Black Widow** Most neogi do not engage in modifying their vessels, using the same configuration regardless of the ship's purpose. The exception to this rule is the Black Widow - a specialized version for use as an attack and retribution craft against enemies who have defeated the neogi in the past. The Black Widow triples the number of ballistas and catapults usually found on a Deathspider. Most of these extra weapons are housed on a large weapons platform which is built on top of the command section and in front of the foreward weapons pit on the citadel deck. The remainder are placed in the flight deck facing aft. In some cases the bridge will be moved to deep within the abdomen, and the former bridge area will be used as a weapons pit for 1-3 greek fire projectors or bombards. A Black Widow will have a mere 10 tons of cargo capacity; less if greek fire projectors or bombards are included as well. These ships also usually overload on crew, requiring a full crew of at least 97 just to man all of the weapons. This overloading does not concern the neogi, since the slaves that survive the battle will typically be eaten on the return trip. Black Widows are never used for any purpose other than warfare. There are rumoured to be as many as a hundred of these ships, but the most that have ever been seen at any time is three, and in this case two attacked each other in a dispute over ownership of the fleet.

\page

**Mind Flayer Trader** The only races that have any regular dealings with the neogi are the arcane and the mind flayers. The former have no known ships, and the latter have their own fleets of Nautiloids and Dreadnoughts. Still, several Deathspiders have been traded to illithids in exchange for large slave hauls. Unfortunately for the illithids, the universal hatred of the neogi is such that these ships are subject to immediate attack from most other ships, without waiting to see what race actually controls the ship. Illithid Deathspiders blacken the dome to spare the mind flayers the light of the suns, and do not retract the dome even in combat. Instead, external weapons platforms are fitted in several locations, to be manned by slaves. Since the introduction of the illithid Dreadnought, no new Deathspiders have been purchased by mind flayers.
